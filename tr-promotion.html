<h1>Transition Plan - Promotion Stage</h1>

<p>
<a href="tr-stages.html">&lt;= Previous</a> | <a href="tr-approval.html">Next =&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
	The goals of the Promotion Stage are
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>to raise awareness of the problems with the current US system;</li>
		<li>to educate the public about our proposed solutions to those problems; and</li>
		<li>to refine our model based on public feedback and discourse.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	The problems mentioned in the <a href="manifesto.html">Manifesto for America</a> and the general parameters of the proposed American State as described in the <a href="constitution.html">Constitution</a> and the <a href="backgrounders.html">Backgrounders</a> are the reasons for our movement. The Promotion Stage is the time for us to explain and demonstrate our perspective on these matters, as well as to discover Americans' reactions to the ideas we present. 
</p>
<p>
	The outcome of the Promotion Stage will be a decision for us - whether to go forward with the Public Approval Stage. If it seems the American people do not consider the systemic problems in the current US system to be serious, or that they prefer to continue to work within the parameters of that system to effect positive change, then we will discontinue our program.
</p>

<h3>Publications, Speeches, Social Media</h3>

<p>
	An obvious way to share information about ideas is to publish books, articles, websites, blogs, videos, and podcasts. We can also hold town meetings and rallies where we can describe our ideas to an audience. Social media is a proven way to share ideas about political change. 
</p>

<h3>Political Party</h3>

<p>
	The proposed American State does not allow political parties, but the State has not been implemented. In the Promotion Stage we are operating within the existing US system. That system allows political parties, and there are quite a few. Only two hold any power, but many others exist. Most of them promote a single idea - clean environment, Puerto Rican statehood, Libertarianism, Socialism, etc. In a sense, they are doing what we will do in the Promotion Stage - making their ideas available to the public.
</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, a candidate representing a secondary party is elected to office on the local level; rarely, at the state level. We can strive to achieve similar results. 
</p>
<p>
	One of us who is elected to public office must fulfill the duties of that office within the parameters of the existing system; we are not free to operate as if the State were a reality. Even so, we can use the amplified public voice of our position to expose hypocrisy, corruption, and injustice wherever we encounter it in the course of our duties. 
</p>
<p>
	Even when constrained by current law to render (or to support) an unjust decision, we can make noise about why the decision is unjust and how it would differ under the State system; exactly what it is about the current system that forces that decision. This helps highlight the systemic injustice of the current system. Many injustices are accepted because no one speaks of them openly. We can at least do that much.
</p>
<p>
	Holding elected office also opens doors that are otherwise closed. We can meet with others in the political power structure and attempt to persuade them to support action that is consistent with our own principles. This is no different than what many others routinely do.
</p>
<p>
	Having an insider view of the political machine will also enable us to learn about the true (possibly hidden) motivations of other political actors. This can be extremely useful for forging alliances and exercising leverage.
</p>
<p>
	As elected officials, we would be sought out for interviews by the media, providing another opportunity to share our ideas with the public.
</p>
<p>
	It is possible some of us would have opportunities to overturn unjust court judgments and other damage done by the current system, due to the role we are playing in our elected position. We should take every opportunity to do the right thing.
</p>

<h3>Political Action</h3>

<p>
	We can attend political rallies and other events organized by other political parties and political action groups, and ensure that someone asks the questions that we believe need to be heard. 
</p>
<p>
	We can try to join the press corps officially, and attempt to ask what the media call "hard questions" when it is our turn to question individuals in positions of power. 
</p>
<p>
	Even if no one answers, and even if we are escorted off the premises by hired thugs, at least the right questions would be heard by many people. This kind of thing can chip away at the existing power structure bit by bit over time. Even if people hear only the question and not the answer, it may provide food for thought.
</p>

<h3>Political Discourse</h3>

<p>
	If our message is ever heard by more than a handful of people, then those opposed to our ideas will do what they can to discredit the ideas and us. This creates the opportunity to respond, and with that response political discourse begins. Rather than feeling insulted by criticism - even outright lies - we should welcome these things, because they open the door to broader discussion. 
</p>
<p>
	At this early stage, being noticed at all is a "win." People will not bother to oppose us unless they feel the ideas we are promoting are powerful enough to threaten the existing power elite. In that sense, opposition is a good litmus test of the value of our ideas.
</p>

<h3>Refinement of the Model</h3>

<p>
	The Promotion Stage puts our ideas forward to the general public, beyond the limited circle of the originators. Many people will object to various details and some will offer suggestions to improve the model for the State government. During this stage, we must remain open to new ideas and to modifying the details of the political model for the better. Others will see weaknesses that we have overlooked.
