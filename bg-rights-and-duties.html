<h1>Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</h1>

<p>
One of the reasons for the State's existence is to uphold and defend the human rights of the people living within its jurisdiction. This Backgrounder describes the philosophical basis for the State's position on the subject, and on the closely-related subjects of human needs, legal rights, privileges, duties, and individual freedom.

<h2>1. Definition of "Human"</h2>

<p>
Before we can consider human needs and rights, we first have to understand what a "human" is. While it may seem obvious in the manner of "I can't define it, but I know it when I see it," there are different opinions about what constitutes a human being, when human life begins and ends, whether all kinds of people deserve to be considered "human," and whether a person can forfeit their humanity (and their human rights along with it) through their choices in life. 
</p>
<p>
One of the duties of the State is to uphold the human rights of the people living within its jurisdiction. To fulfill that duty, we need to have a point of view about what is or is not a "human." It would be impractical to try and accommodate all the different opinions people have. In fact, Americans have demonstrated to our complete satisfaction that they are incapable of agreeing on a definition of "human" that all can accept. Therefore, we will craft a definition for purposes of this political model, and present it in a directive way, not open to debate. We relieve Americans of the burden of this difficult task.
</p>

<a name="cat1"/>
<h3>1.1. Category 1: Human capable of standing for their own rights</h3>

<p>
These are imbued with human rights <em>by nature</em>. Neither the State nor any individual can legally limit or remove human rights from them for any reason. Their human rights are a characteristic of their humanity.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>An individual born by natural childbirth</li>
	<li>An individual born by Caesarean section</li>
	<li>An individual born by emergency medical extraction when the mother was in distress</li>
	<li>An individual who resulted from artificial insemination of the mother</li>
	<li>An individual born of a surrogate mother</li>	
	<li>An individual cultivated in an incubation system, not in a living mother</li>
	<li>An individual created by a cloning process</li>
	<li>A pregnant woman</li>
	<li>An individual who has some intrinsic characteristic different from the statistical norm of the society</li>
	<li>An individual who has carried out horrific acts, such as mass murder</li>	
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Three of the items in this category bear further explanation. 
</p>
<p>
Why is "a pregnant woman" listed separately? In the present-day US, approximately half the population does not consider a pregnant woman to have any human rights. She had human rights prior to becoming pregnant, and she regains them after giving birth, but during the pregnancy she has none. In case of a conflict between the human rights of a pregnant woman and the viable unborn child she carries, these people believe the human rights of the unborn child absolutely trump the human rights of the woman. It is possible most Americans who think this way would be surprised to hear their views described in these terms, but their behavior demonstrates they believe this.
</p>
<p>
We want to bring this idea forward to clarify that the human rights of both those individuals are considered of <em>equal</em> value; one is not "worth more" than the other. It is proper for a responsible party to defend the human rights of the unborn child (see Category 2); in this case the natural candidate is the mother herself, and the State must not interfere in her decision or make the already-difficult choice any more traumatic for her. In the event a choice must be made to terminate the pregnancy, it is appropriate to acknowledge the humanity of the unborn child and to honor its memory, but inappropriate to insist that the woman also die. Utilitarian ethics call for the choice that does the least harm. One death is preferable to two.
</p>
<p>
Why do we explicitly include people who have intrinsic characteristics different from the statistical norm of society? In the present-day US, approximately half the population does not consider a person to be fully human if they differ in any way from the majority - skin color, nationality, sexual orientation, etc. The State's view is that a human is a human. There is no need to define numerous distinct groups of "human" and pass laws that specifically grant human rights to each group. The sinister implication of that approach is that if your group happens to be overlooked, then by default you have no human rights. We solve this by treating all humans as humans without regard to their intrinsic characteristics, lifestyle choices, or personal beliefs. 
</p>
<p>
Why is the mass murderer included in the list of humans? In the present-day US, approximately half the population supports the death penalty for serious crimes such as murder. They consider that the offender has forfeited their status as a "human" by taking the life of another. The State's view is that the existence of a death penalty in the legal code marks a country as uncivilized. Carrying out the death penalty damages the society, in a sense making everyone a killer. Appropriate punishments for serious crimes can be applied short of killing the offender. However heinous the crime, the inherent humanity of the offender remains inviolate.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, there are distinctions to be made between external and domestic actors. An individual who kills Americans on behalf of an external power (whether or not the offender is a foreigner) is committing an act of war, not a simple crime. It is appropriate to kill enemy combatants. Doing so does not carry the same moral baggage as the death penalty for simple crimes. 
</p>
<p>
Regarding domestic actors, killers are usually a product of the society; some aspects of the individuals' life experience led them to become killers. This is typically true of mass shooters in the present-day US. Therefore, it is appropriate for the society that produced the killer to pay for their upkeep in prison, as a reminder that they should think about ways to improve society so that we produce fewer killers. This point partially supports the State's approach to healthcare, as well - mental and psychological health are fully covered. 
</p>

<a name="cat2"/>
<h3>1.2. Category 2: Human who needs another to stand for their rights</h3>

<p>
These are imbued with human rights. They are the same as individuals in Category 1, except that they cannot stand up for their own rights without assistance. A responsible party, such as a family member or a legally-assigned proxy, must defend their human rights. If no such party exists, it falls to the State to defend their human rights. In any case, the responsible party may be called upon to make difficult decisions regarding the life or death of the individual. They must do so within the parameters of the law and on the basis of utilitarian ethics.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>A viable fetus not yet born, developing normally</li>
	<li>An individual born with a condition that renders them unable to function independently</li>
	<li>An individual who has suffered severe brain damage and is no longer functional or self-aware</li>
	<li>An individual whose brain has deteriorated from disease and is no longer functional or self-aware</li>
	<li>An individual who is "technically" alive only because they are maintained by medical equipment</li>
	<li>An individual who is in a coma</li>
	<li>An individual who has been medically dead for a few minutes but could conceivably be revived</li>	
</ul>
</p>

<a name="cat3"/>
<h3>1.3. Category 3: Early pregnancy</h3>

<p>
All of these situations (except stillbirth) fall between conception and the second trimester or pregnancy. It is necessary to call these situations out explicitly because many people believe life begins at the time of conception. However, it is natural for many pregnancies to fail in the first few weeks. In these cases, the tissue within the woman's body that may have become a human being, had conditions been different, is not a human being. It never reached that stage of development.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>A zygote</li>
	<li>An embryo developing normally in a healthy mother</li>
	<li>A blastocyst that fails to implant into the uterine lining</li>
	<li>The tissue expelled in a natural miscarriage</li>
	<li>The tissue reabsorbed into the woman's body after a pregnancy fails to "take"</li>	
	<li>A stillbirth</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It is possible that the first three situations could become viable, given advances in medical technology. It may become possible for the zygote, embryo, or blastocyst to be removed from the woman and cultivated under artificial conditions. It would then become "an individual cultivated in an incubation system, not in a living mother." They would fall into Category 1 or 2, depending on how self-sufficient they become. As of this writing, that is not a reality, but the State must remain open to adjusting statutory law to keep pace with medical and technological advances.
</p>
<p>
It is necessary to discuss this category because in the present-day US, as well as in certain other countries, there is a belief that when a woman experiences a natural miscarriage or stillbirth, she is guilty of murder. Women have been convicted and imprisoned in the states of Arkansas, Alabama, Illinois, Virginia, and California on this basis, and similar laws have been proposed in Georgia and Pennsylvania. More examples may have emerged since this was written. The country of El Salvador has defined miscarriage as murder for a number of years; some 180 women are currently serving prison sentences for having miscarriages. The penalty for murder in El Salvador is 30 years in prison. All these examples cause damage that far exceeds the putative benefits of protecting the unborn. Therefore, they fail the utilitarian ethics test.
</p>
<p>
The State's goal is to ensure human rights are protected for all humans. We want the broadest possible definition of "human" so that we will not overlook anyone who deserves human rights. We are aware of two arguments in favor of considering life to begin at the point of conception. Here are the reasons we ultimately rejected them.
</p>
<p>
The first is a religious argument. The idea is that pregnancy is a gift from God. Whatever happens with the pregnancy, for good or ill, is God's will. Humans are not to interfere with God's will, no matter the cost. The State cannot adopt this argument - even if many individuals who administer the government believe it - because of the strict separation of government and religion (see the Backgrounder on <a href="bg-religion-and-state.html">Religion and the State</a>). Utilitarian ethics guides us to the conclusion that conflating religion with government would do far more harm (in many ways, not only this) than keeping the two cleanly separate.
</p>
<p>
The second is a teleological argument. The <em>telos</em> of a fertilized human egg is to grow into a human being. It cannot become anything else besides a human being, assuming the pregnancy is carried to a successful birth. The zygote-embryo-fetus cannot end up as a ham sandwich or a fire hydrant. Therefore, to err on the side of caution with respect to human rights, it makes sense to treat the item as a "potential human." 
</p>
<p>
	The teleological argument does not run afoul of the separation of government and religion, nor does it contravene utilitarian ethics. However, the fact it is natural for many pregnancies to fail means that there is no "potential human" until development reaches the fetal stage. In the attempt to treat a fertilized egg as a complete human being, we would inevitably deny the fundamental human rights of pregnant women. This would constitute the greater harm, in terms of utilitarian ethics. 
</p>
<p>
	It has proven impossible to define a starting point for human life that everyone can accept fully. Therefore, the State defines the start of human life as the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy.
</p>

<a name="cat4"/>
<h3>1.4. Category 4: Human status is undetermined at this time</h3>

<p>
At the time of writing, these situations are more philosophical or speculative than practical. We do not consider it necessary to include them in the definition of "human" for our immediate purposes. However, consideration of these (and possibly other) situations may become necessary, depending on technological advances, biological evolution, or encounters with other life forms.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>A person's memories and personality installed in an artificial body or machine</li>
	<li>A synthetic person or artificial intelligence, never formerly a biological entity</li>
	<li>A computer network that becomes self-aware</li>
	<li>A member of a species other than <em>H. sapiens</em> that exhibits human-like qualities</li>	
</ul>
</p>

<a name="cat5"/>
<h3>1.5. Category 5: Formerly human, deserving of respect</h3>

<p>
While these individuals were human during their lifetimes, there is no longer a practical reason to protect their human rights. However, except for the last one, they are remembered by those who survived them, and they are worthy of respect. It is conceivable their estate or their survivors could need legal support based on the deceased human rights, and the State will not close the door on that need.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>An individual who has died, been embalmed, and buried</li>
	<li>An individual who has died and been cremated</li>
	<li>An individual who has died, been placed in a tomb or cemetery, and who is regularly visited by living relatives who share meals and conversations with them</li>
	<li>An individual who lived many years ago</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="lifespan"/>
<h3>1.6. Definition of the Human Lifespan</h3>

<p>
This is the official definition for legal purposes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human life begins with the onset of the second trimester of pregnancy, or the artificial equivalent of same by technological means (including cloning), and ends when the individual reaches the point after medical death when they can no longer be revived to a self-aware, functioning state using technology currently available at a cost accessible to the individual's estate or legal representatives.</strong>
</p>
<p>
With this definition in mind, the rights described in this Backgrounder apply only to Categories 1 and 2. 
</p>

<a name="corp"/>
<h3>1.7. Status of Corporations</h3>

<p>
This section concerns the legal status of corporations. The word "corporation" in this context is understood to mean any and all forms of organization - non-profits, charitable, religious, labor unions, etc. 
</p>


<h4>1.7.1. Corporations are Not Persons</h4>
<p>
In the present-day US, registered business entities are treated as "persons" for most purposes under the law. In the State system, business entities are <em>not</em> considered equivalent to "persons." 
</p>

<h4>1.7.2. Corporations May Be Subject to Regulation</h4>
<p>
Many categories of business operations are subject to government oversight and regulation, for the purposes of (a) maintaining the Three Pillars of independence, (b) assuring human rights and legal rights are upheld, and (c) holding responsible parties accountable for harm done to people, the environment, or property. 
</p>

<h4>1.7.3. A Corporation is Not a Legal Shield</h4>
<p>
Corporate status will not be a shield for the individuals who operate the enterprise from the consequences of their decisions, policies, and actions. Lawsuits or criminal charges brought against a corporation are automatically brought against the registered leaders of that corporation. The details will depend on the organizational form of the corporation. 
</p>


<a name="needs"/>
<h2>2. Human Needs</h2>

<p>
This section explains the State's view of human needs in the context of its purpose and function as a governing body.
</p>

<a name="maslow"/>
<h3>2.1. A Reference Model of Human Needs</h3>

<p>
Models are imperfect, but sometimes useful representations of ideas. To understand human needs, we refer to a model known as <em>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</em>. The model is usually presented in popular culture in a way that diverges from Abraham Maslow's intent, but it still contains useful ideas - notably, the distinction between <em>deficiency needs</em> and <em>growth needs</em>. A deficiency need arises when something necessary for life is missing. A growth need arises when an individual has the ambition to achieve a goal. The distinction is useful in crafting a model for government, because the State's role is different for each category. 
</p>

<a name="deficiency"/>
<h3>2.2. The State's Role with Respect to Deficiency Needs</h3>

<p>
One of the State's responsibilities is to ensure the country can operate on a sustainable basis in a way that supports people's rights and freedom. When people's deficiency needs are unmet, they cannot freely operate their businesses or conduct their personal lives as they see fit. They become vulnerable to external influencers who can take advantage of their need for basic necessities. That vulnerability represents an existential threat to the State. An existential threat to the State is, in turn, a threat to Americans' individual liberty. Therefore, it is appropriate for the State to take a direct hand in assuring everyone's deficiency needs are met.
</p>

<a name="growth"/>
<h3>2.3. The State's Role with Respect to Growth Needs</h3>

<p>
One of the most basic growth needs is the ability for people to achieve success through their own efforts. Therefore, it is impossible for the State (or any other government) to provide growth needs directly, as an entitlement. To do so would be to deny people the ability to achieve success through their own efforts.
</p>
<p>
The State's role is to establish and maintain general conditions that enable people to pursue their goals without undue difficulty or interference, but not to guarantee or directly provide desired outcomes. This mainly involves economic and physical security considerations, such as currency stability, a robust and fair banking system, a guaranteed minimum income, a livable minimum wage, effective law enforcement, public education, and universal healthcare, including mental healthcare. When people do not have to expend all their resources to meet deficiency needs, they are free to exercise their individual liberty to pursue growth needs.
</p>

<a name="lighttouch"/>
<h3>2.4. Government with a Light Touch</h3>

<p>
It would be impractical for the State to provide these things directly. Furthermore, history shows us that centrally-managed economic systems and government-operated healthcare systems do not work well. Our preference is for minimal government, but not so minimal that the State fails to meet its obligations to the people. Due to the size of the country, the administrative apparatus of the State will never be "small" as such; but we prefer to avoid bureaucratic bloat. The State can support human needs through regulation, oversight, tax incentives, and other measures that encourage individuals and business entities to "do the right things."
</p>
<p>
A summary of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is available online at URL <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html</a>. Many other descriptions and critiques are also available. 
</p>


<a name="humanrights"/>
<h2>3. Human Rights</h2>

<p>
We have asserted that all humans have certain fundamental rights <em>by nature</em>. Every human has those rights by virtue of the fact they are human; a human need do nothing to earn them, and can do nothing to forfeit them. These rights are as much a part of a human as their blood and bones. They are not granted by anyone, and cannot be taken away by anyone - not by a government or a business entity or any other group or individual, such as a labor union, a religion, a corporation, or a private club. What are those rights, specifically?
</p>


<a name="history"/>
<h3>3.1. Useful Ideas from Historical Documents</h3>

<p>
While we have generally reasoned from first principles to arrive at a list of fundamental human rights, we find it useful to draw ideas from existing historical documents that deal with the subject of rights. A few of these documents are particularly relevant.
</p>

<a name="enumerations"/>
<h4>3.1.1. Historical Enumerations of Rights</h4>

<p>
The definitive definition of human rights in the Western world and in modern times is the United Nations <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> (UDHR). 
</p>
<p>
Documents published subsequent to 1948 (at least in the Western world) tend to duplicate the language in the UDHR. For example, consider the UK <em>Human Rights Act</em> (1998), the <em>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</em> (1966), and the <em>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</em> (1966). These are near duplicates of the UDHR. As they are largely redundant, we have not found value in them beyond what is provided in the UDHR.
</p>
<p>
Another exemplary enumeration of rights is found in the <em>Constitution of the United States of America</em> (US Constitution). The part of the US Constitution from which we draw ideas is the Bill of Rights, specifically Amendments 1 and 3 through 9. 
</p>

<a name="influences"/>
<h4>3.1.2. Contemporary and Regional Influences in Historical Documents</h4>

<p>
In all historical documents, the enumeration of rights has been influenced by events or conditions that affected the authors. They wanted either to preserve their own privilege or to protect people from abuses of the kind that had occurred recently in their experience. 
</p>
<p>
For example, the UDHR was issued by the United Nations in 1948 in the wake of World War II. Its content is strongly influenced by the abuses carried out in that war. Most of its articles mention specific abuses of that war, and call for people to be protected from such treatment.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil</em> contains language forbidding racism, as racism had been a feature of Brazilian culture and government since the founding of the country, and remains a cultural and social pain point to this day. Rather than serving as a framework for statutory law, many passages in the Brazilian constitution are aspirational, describing the kind of society they want to achieve. 
</p>
<p>
The founding documents of the US refer to the right of "life, liberty, and property." The concept goes back to the 17th century English philosopher John Locke. He wrote of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," in which "happiness" meant the freedom to amass real estate and wealth without interference from the government. "The Founders," as the authors of those documents are called, were concerned with property because they belonged to the small power elite of the time. Their position was based on real estate holdings. They sought to ensure their power would be preserved in the laws of the new country, yet carefully crafted the language to avoid saying so directly, to avoid uprisings by the majority of people, who enjoyed none of those three rights except "technically," on paper. 
</p>
<p>
In our view (and according to our formal definition of the terms "freedom" and "bondage"), having a right on paper is not sufficient; people must have the practical ability to act on their rights.
</p>

<a name="kindergarten"/>
<h4>3.1.3. Kindergarten Wisdom and Enumerated Rights</h4>

<p>
There were certain rights The Founders of the US had assumed were obvious. It is possible they were thinking in a way similar to us, when we talk about Kindergarten Wisdom; things we think are obvious may not be obvious to everyone. Once the US Constitution became a reality people started to worry that important rights had not been enumerated in the document. The first several amendments to the US Constitution spell out these rights. That is the reason the first ten Amendments are known, collectively, as The Bill of Rights.
</p>
<p>
The First Amendment could actually have been five separate items, assuring freedom of religion, speech, the press, assembly, and petition. The third through eighth amendments continue the enumeration of basic rights. Our model includes these rights.
</p>
<p>
The Ninth Amendment is interesting, as it clarifies the intent that the enumerated rights were not the complete definition of people's rights: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." The Brazilian constitution expresses the same idea in Chapter I, Article 5, Clause II: "[N]o one shall be obliged to do or refrain from doing something except by virtue of law."
</p>
<p>
Back in the Cold War days, a Soviet visitor to the US remarked that the difference between the two countries was that in the US everything is permitted unless it is expressly forbidden, and in the USSR everything is forbidden unless it is expressly permitted. This reflects the philosophy expressed in the Ninth Amendment to the US Constitution and in the cited clause of the Brazilian Constitution.
</p>
<p>
The State takes the view that everyone can do as they please, provided they do not interfere with anyone else's ability to do the same, and they do not undermine the Three Pillars of independence. We refer to the idea as Kindergarten Wisdom: One's rights end where the next person's begin. 
</p>

<a name="categorization"/>
<h4>3.1.4. Differences in Categorization of Rights</h4>

<p>
The UDHR includes rights that we consider <em>human rights</em> (Articles 1 through 5, 9, 15 through 20, 23, 25 through 27, and 30) and others we consider <em>legal rights</em> (Articles 6 through 8 and 21). 
</p>
<p>
A few, like Article 14 about asylum, and Article 28 about the "international order," are out of scope for our model, which is national. Some Articles appear to address specific problems of the day, like Article 27 about the right to participate in the cultural life of the community. We do not think this needs to be said; it seems to be a response to problems of the WW II era.
</p>
<p>
The Second and Tenth Amendments of the US Constitution are not relevant to our model. 
</p>
<p>
The Second Amendment was a nod to slave states, whose leaders feared a strong central government dominated by free states might limit their ability to raise slave patrols to collect escapees. That is what they meant by "a well-regulated militia." It is another example of a "right" that was influenced by the conditions of the time and place it was defined, like certain UDHR Articles and certain clauses in the Brazilian Constitution as well as other historical enumerations of rights. 
</p>
<p>
The interpretation of the Second Amendment has changed since that time. Today it is understood as an individual right to own firearms rather than a state right to organize a militia. The concept does not carry over into our model in exactly the same sense.
</p>
<p>
In our view, firearms are part of a larger category of things that we call "dangerous items." The legal ability to own and use dangerous items falls under the heading of <em>privileges</em> rather than <em>rights</em>, as such items require training, licensure, and periodic review to ensure responsible use. Industrial machinery, heavy construction equipment, automobiles and trucks, trains, aircraft, explosives, firearems, poisons, radioactive material, pharmaceutical products, certain medical devices, and other items may fall into this category. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Regulations</em> rather than statutory law will govern these matters, as regulations are more easily defined and modified than statutory law, and the details will vary depending on the nature of each dangerous item. In keeping with our "light touch" approach to governing, we want to avoid overcomplicating the Legal Code with details about how to handle radioactive materials, firearms, or automobiles. It is sufficient that the Legal Code authorizes the State to establish regulations and monitor compliance.
</p>
<p>
The Tenth Amendment has to do with the relationship between the federal government and the states. This is irrelevant in our model, as there are no states.
</p>

<a name="enumeration"/>
<h3>3.2. Enumeration of Human Rights</h3>

<p>
The State considers the following to be human rights that cannot be abridged. The State accepts the <em>duty</em> to uphold these rights for all citizens, and to provide at least minimal support for other people living within its jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>The right to life.</strong> The State is prohibited from ending a person's life through an administrative procedure, regardless of the person's offense. Other organizations and individuals are likewise prohibited from ending anyone's life. 
		<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> In case it is unclear, this effectively prohibits the death penalty categorically.
		<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> An individual who invites death by carrying out acts of terrorism or attacking other people may die in the process, and this is not considered an "administrative procedure" for purposes of defining the right to life. If law enforcement officers or individuals defending themselves end the life of a violent offender in the act, it is not considered a violation of this right.
		<br/><br/><em>Note 3:</em> Implicit in the right to life is the right to defend your own life and the lives of those around you if you are attacked. Such defense is not a violation of the attacker's right to life.
		<br/><br/><em>Note 4:</em> There will be cases in which a pregnant woman must terminate the pregnancy and end the life of the unborn child. When done as a necessary medical procedure to protect the woman's life, this is not considered a violation of the right to life of the unborn child. This is not a question at all unless the unborn child has reached the stage of development corresponding to our formal definition of "human life."
		<br/><br/><em>Note 5:</em> This right protects one's life from <em>others</em>, including individuals, organizations, and the State. It is not intended to restrict an individual's freedom of choice with respect to <em>their own</em> life, if they need to consider suicide as an alternative to extended pain and suffering due to disease. That is considered a personal healthcare decision. In such a case, an individual designated as the healthcare proxy for the person in question has the duty to make this choice on behalf of the person suffering.</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to physical security.</strong> This includes security from predictable natural phenomena, crime, terrorism, and war, to the extent practical. It also includes security from law enforcement brutality and torture.
		<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> Protection from predictable natural phenomena is likely to be supported through tax incentives, inspections and fines, and construction standards aimed at ensuring structures are built to withstand the conditions typical of the locale, such as hurricanes, floods, drought, extreme temperatures, tornadoes, and earthquakes; it does not mean people will absolutely be safe from all natural phenomena.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to personal liberty.</strong> Everyone can do as they please provided they do not interfere with anyone else's ability to do as they please, and they do not undermine the Three Pillars of independence. The Legal Code is meant to cover these situations, so any necessary and reasonable limitations on personal liberty are documented. Implicit in the right to personal liberty are: freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom to live in a place of one's choosing, freedom to own property, and freedom to travel.
        <br/><br/><em>Note:</em> Kindergarten Wisdom applies. Freedom of religion does not include insinuating your religious beliefs into the Legal Code, as that would interfere with the rights of those who believe differently; freedom of assembly does not include forming a mob to attack people or structures; freedom of speech does not mean freedom from the natural consequences of whatever you choose to say; freedom to choose where to live and to own property means you cannot be discriminated against in the housing or real estate market, not that you can literally move into any house just because you like it.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to live in freedom.</strong> Per the definitions given in this model, "freedom" is a condition of life in which the individual has the <em>practical and realistic ability</em> to pursue their personal liberty. It is also the opposite of "bondage," a condition of life in which the individual cannot realistically act on choices that are available in principle. This definition of "bondage" covers slavery as well as wage slavery and all forms of coerced work.
        <br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> Due to the State's duty to ensure fundamental human rights are upheld, this right implies certain services must be provided - almost entirely at taxpayer expense - such as universal healthcare, paid sick leave, paid parental leave, subsidized child care, and a guaranteed minimum income. TAANSTAFL (There ain't no such thing as a free lunch, Robert Heinlein).
        <br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> The use of prison inmates to perform labor at low pay or no pay is strictly prohibited. It is considered a form of bondage.
        </li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of the sanctity of the home.</strong> No one may enter your home or trespass on your property without your permission, except (a) law enforcement personnel who have obtained a search warrant, and (b) emergency responders who must enter your home to deal with a problem (fire, gas leak, heart attack victim, etc.).
		<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> This covers the obvious cases - trespassers, burglars, home invaders - as well as cases that may not be obvious to those accustomed to living in the US, including electronic intrusion in the form of unsolicited calls, texts, and emails, as well as "junk mail," flyers placed on doors, and advertisements placed in mailboxes. No one is required to "answer the door" or "answer the phone" just because a bell is ringing. All these nuisances are prohibited by law in our system.
		<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> The verbage about emergency responders is not meant to preclude passers-by or neighbors from acting to help people in need. 
		<br/><br/><em>Note 3:</em> Due to the State's duty to ensure fundamental human rights are upheld, and the fact this right is listed in the category of human rights, and the fact the State upholds the principle of "innocent until proven guilty," the State must reimburse you for any damage done to the property, any items damaged by law enforcement in their search, and any items stolen from the premises during the time your normal security measures are left in a disabled condition resulting from officers' forcing entry (for instance, broken front door lock). This applies even if you are ultimately proven guilty of the crime in question, as you are presumed innocent as of the time of the search.
		<br/><br/><em>Note 4:</em> Owing to the cultural significance of personal automobiles in the present-day US, some jurisdictions have passed laws that define a person's automobile as an extenson of their home. We consider this absurd. Your vehicle is not your home unless you live in it. If you <em>do</em> happen to live in a vehicle, then this right applies to it.

<h2>4. Legal Rights</h2>

<p>
Legal rights pertain to the interactions between individuals and the court system and law enforcement. Most of the background information about legal rights has been mentioned in the section on human rights, as published documents that enumerate rights tend to conflate the two categories. 
</p>

<p>
The distinguishing characteristic of legal rights as opposed to human rights is that legal rights are granted by the State and can be modified by the State by following the documented procedures for changing the Legal Code. 
</p>

<a name="primacy"/>
<h3>4.1. The Primacy of Human Rights</h3>

<p>
No legal procedure may violate any human rights. When a legal procedure is determined to be in violation of human rights, it will be declared null and void.
</p>

<a name="enumlegal"/>
<h3>4.2. Enumeration of Legal Rights</h3>

<p>
Here are the legal rights recognized by the State:
</p>
<p>
	<ol>

		<li><strong>The right of equal protection under the law.</strong> All persons within the State's jurisdiction are entitled to the protection of the law and to all rights governing the interaction of law enforcement personnel and the courts with individuals.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of protection from arbitrary arrest and detention.</strong> Law enforcement personnel are authorized to detain, arrest, and question suspects, and to hold them for a reasonable time before bringing formal charges against them. The time period is a matter for statutory law. Law enforcement must be able to show reasonable cause for an arrest. The details of what it means to "show reasonable cause" is a matter for statutory law.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of protection from harassment.</strong> Law enforcement personnel, the courts and their agents, attorneys, and anyone else acting on behalf of a person who has a complaint against another person must refrain from harassing anyone.
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> This is in response to the situation in the present-day US wherein police officers routinely harass black people and other non-whites or "apparent" foreigners, as well as male officers harassing females to coerce them into sex. It also covers cases when attorneys or parties interested in a dispute harass those on the opposing side of the dispute. It also covers harassment by bill collectors, telemarketers, door-to-door salespeople, fund raisers, street vendors, and anyone else for all purposes.</em>
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of protection from torture.</strong> Suspects may be held for questioning and interrogated using a wide range of methods, none of which is permitted to include severe methods a reasonable person would consider "torture." This right applies everywhere and always; law enforcement personnel may not avoid it by moving the suspect to an "unofficial" location. 
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to be presumed innocent.</strong> Suspects must be treated as not guilty of the crimes with which they are charged unless and until they are found to be guilty by a court of law. 
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> Provided law enforcement has shown evidence of cause to hold a suspect before trial, presumption of innocence does not mean the suspect must be released from custody.</em>
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to timely adjudication.</strong> The authorities must carry out a hearing or trial within a specified time from the date charges are brought against a suspect. The time period is defined in statutory law. If the time is exceeded and no hearing or trial has been held, the suspect must be released from custody to await trial. After a second waiting period, to be defined in statutory law and probably longer than the initial period, if no hearing or trial has been held, the charges are automatically dropped. 
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> This carries a risk that a dangerous person might have to be released. The purpose is not to endanger the public, but to provide an incentive for law enforcement and the courts to provide timely adjudication, with no excuses, and no practical way to "game" the system in order to keep someone incarcerated without trial or charges.</em>
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to a public hearing.</strong> All trials must be open to the public.
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> Preliminary hearings whose purpose is to finalize procedural details in advance of a trial need not be public. Also, trials in which evidence may include details pertaining to national defense may be closed to the public, after a formal request by the court to the Decision Making Council has been approved. Any citizen who believes (and can provide credible evidence) that this provision has been abused may call for an investigation of the court(s) and/or Council member(s) suspected of involvement.</em>
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to fair punishment.</strong> Each category of crime will be defined in the Legal Code with a range of punishment from mild to severe. Courts and juries are free to select punishments within that range, based on their assessment of the circumstances of the case. In all cases, the available punishments must be appropriate to the severity of the crime. In all cases, punishments must be consistent with human rights. The right of eligibility for parole must not be circumvented by "piling on" multiple sentences.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> The Backgrounder on <a href="bg-crime.html">Crime and Punishment</a> provides guidelines for determining fair punishment, based on extent of harm done, offender's intent, circumstances surrounding the incident, and the letter of the law. The letter of the law is not necessarily followed mechanically, in a mindless and inhumane way.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> For financial crimes, the degree of damage will be considered in determining fair punishment. The officers of a corporation that intentionally defrauds people of their life savings and/or their homes may be sentenced to prison. However, an individual who falls behind in paying their taxes or paying private-sector debts cannot be sentenced to prison. They can only be subject to financial penalties. Such penalties must not be so burdensome as to deny the human rights of the offender.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to legal representation.</strong> Suspects have the right to engage the attorney(s) of their choice or to be assigned an attorney by the State. They also have the option to speak in their own defense. 
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to hold one's peace.</strong> When detained or arrested, an individual has no duty to speak to law enforcement personnel. No coercion or retribution is permitted.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to honesty.</strong> Should a suspect waive their right to hold their peace, anything they say to law enforcement personnel must be truthful, to the best of their knowledge. Similarly, law enforcement personnel must not lie to or attempt to trick suspects. 
			<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> This right also implies a <em>duty</em> to be honest. The duty is connected with a part of the legal philosophy described in the Backgrounder on <a href="bg.crime.html">Crime and Punishment</a>, in that if dishonesty results in <em>harm</em> to an individual or to the public generally, it can be treated as a crime. This applies equally to law enforcement personnel and "civilians," consistent with the right to equal protection under the law.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> The necessity for this right to be explicitly stated is the common practice in the present-day US that police are permitted to lie to suspects, but it is a crime for a suspect to lie to the police. Law enforcement and suspects will be held to the same standard of honesty.</em>
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right not to incriminate oneself.</strong> When detained or arrested, and during interrogation, hearings, and trials, an individual may elect not to answer certain questions, at their own discretion. No coercion or retribution is permitted.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to compensation for wrongful treatment.</strong> When arrest, detention, false charges, charges that are not proven in court, or visible law enforcement activity around the home or workplace of a suspect result in material damage such as job loss, emotional harm such as spousal abandonment, or reputational damage, the wronged individual may seek compensation through the court system.
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> Damage to and loss of property caused by law enforcement forcing entry into a home with a search warrant are covered in the human rights section under The Right of the Sanctity of the Home.</em>
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to compensation for wrongful conviction.</strong> When it is determined that an individual was wrongly convicted of a crime, they or their survivors will be entitled to compensation from the State for time served and potential lost income.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of just treatment while incarcerated.</strong> Law enforcement personnel and their assignees are prohibited from harassing or harming inmates who are serving sentences in prison facilities. Inmates are entitled to food, water, basic clothing, basic healthcare, reasonable protection from temperature extremes, and a clean place to sleep. Their punishment consists of spending time in prison, and nothing additional beyond that. In addition, prison personnel are required to protect inmates from other inmates.  
			<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> The use of prison inmates as slaves is prohibited under human rights provisions.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> Inmates who behave violently may have to be subdued by force. It is possible they will be harmed in the process. Law enforcement personnel will not be held liable in that case. Those who abuse this provision by lying about the circumstances under which an inmate was injured or killed will be held accountable in the same way as someone who commits battery "out in the world."
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of appeal.</strong> Anyone convicted of a crime may file an appeal within a defined time period following the conviction. They can appeal up to a maximum number of times. The time period for filing an appeal and the maximum number of appeals will be defined in the Legal Code.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to avoid double jeopardy.</strong> An individual who is acquitted of a charge may not be charged and re-tried for the same offense, unless it is demonstrated that crucial evidence was withheld, suppressed, or misrepresented in the original trial. 
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of eligibility for parole.</strong> For certain offenses, the possibility of parole may be included in the definition of the offense and its available punishments. Anyone convicted of such an offense will become eligible for parole under the terms defined in the Legal Code, and cannot be denied this opportunity. <em>Eligibility</em> for parole does not imply parole will be granted. Each case will be reviewed with an eye to public safety.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right to due process of the law.</strong> If it is demonstrated that correct procedures were not followed in handling a case, the charges may be waived by a court and the suspect released with a clean record.
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> To avoid bureaucratic abuse of this right by focusing solely on the letter of the law ("case dismissed on a technicality"), if the courts and/or law enforcement can show they acted in good faith and made their best effort to follow procedures, they can argue for the case to remain open, or to re-open a case that had been dismissed on this basis.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of timely release.</strong> When an inmate has completed their sentence, or when investigation proves an inmate was wrongly convicted, the individual must be released immediately, with no delay longer than the time it takes to process the release paperwork.
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> In this era of high technology, it will be difficult to justify any "paperwork delay" longer than a few seconds.</em>
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of protest.</strong> Citizens may protest policies or actions of the State, or of any public or private sector organization, in public and by means of technology. Actions that harm people or damage property, either in person or in cyberspace, are not considered to be "protest," and are not protected by law. Actions taken in the name of "protest" that subvert the Three Pillars of Independence may be prosecuted at the discretion of the State.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> The word "citizen" is chosen intentionally. Many non-citizens may be in country legally or illegally. They do not enjoy the right to protest the State. The citizens <em>are</em> the State; they are the ones with a stake in how the State operates. Others are in country at the pleasure of the American people.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> Statutory law may define procedures to be followed when organizing a large-scale protest, in the interest of public safety. This is not an abridgement of the right of protest as such. The fact procedures may be necessary, and that law enforcement personnel may have to protect protesters from counter-protesters, makes this a legal right rather than a human right in our system.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 3:</em> Protesters may protest at locations that are effective for their purposes. For example, workers protesting conditions on a job site may protest in front of the corporate head office rather than only at the job site.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 4:</em>  The definition of "large scale" for purposes of this right will defined in statutory law.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of petition.</strong> Citizens may petition the State to change statutory law or to revise government policies and administrative procedures. 
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> The principle is stated here; the details are a matter for the Constitution and the Legal Code.
		</li>

		<li class="linespace"><strong>The right of citizenship.</strong> Once a person becomes a citizen of the State by any legal means, their Basic Citizenship can never be stripped from them by any authority for any reason. 
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> The principle is stated here; the details are a matter for the Constitution and the Legal Code.

<a name="privileges"/>
<h2>5. Privileges</h2>

<p>
<em>Privileges</em> are activities people are allowed to carry out subject to their following regulations that govern the activity. The regulations governing a particular activity differ based on the characteristics of the activity. The details are out of scope for a Backgrounder, but in general we are thinking of activities such as the following:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Performing skilled work that has implications for people's safety, health, or financial state. Examples include medicine, engineering, electrical work, plumbing, accounting, and other work with similar implications for people.</li>
		<li class="linespace">Managing and operating businesses that can have a significant negative impact on the economy or can threaten the Three Pillars of independence. Examples include food production and distribution; transportation infrastructure; construction; energy production and distribution, military products, logistics, and operations; banking and financial services; and anything else that has similar implications.</li>
		<li class="linespace">Owning and using <em>dangerous items</em>. In kindergarten terms, a dangerous item is something that can hurt people by virtue of the way it normally functions, and therefore requires skilled and mindful use. Examples include the handling of hazardous materials such as corrosives, poisons, explosives, flammable material, and radioactive material; the operation of heavy construction equipment, mining equipment, agricultural equipment, and similar; piloting aircraft and ships; driving trucks and automobiles; handling firearms; and anything else that involves items that are inherently dangerous, even when used properly.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>




<a name="duties"/>
<h2>6. Duties</h2>

<p>
<em>Duties</em> are actions (or restraint from action) that are expected of the State, of Citizens, of non-Citizens, and of corporations and other organizations. Specific duties will depend on the formal responsibilities of the organization or individual in question and their relationship with other organizations and individuals in the political/economic/social system. 
</p>
<p>
For example, the State has specific duties with respect to Citizens, organizations, and residents/visitors within its jurisdiction, such as defending and upholding human rights and legal rights, and an overall duty to the country to maintain independence through the Three Pillars, as the basis for individual liberty. A Citizen has a duty to participate in the political system by paying taxes and casting votes. All individuals have a duty to other individuals to respect their rights, according to Kindergarten Wisdom. A corporation has duties to the community where it does business, to its customers, to its employees and contractors, and to the natural environment.
</p>
<p>
The philosophical underpinnings of rights, privileges, and duties are described in Backgrounders. The details are defined in the Constitution, the Legal Code, and Regulations. 
</p>




<a name="freedom"/>
<h2>7. Freedom</h2>

<p>
Although these documents mention numerous responsibilities and duties, as well as practical limitations on what individuals may choose to do, in fact the core value of the entire model is individual liberty. Details that may appear to limit or constrain individual liberty are all aimed at establishing and sustaining an environment within which the people can enjoy the maximum practical level of individual freedom. 
</p>
<p>
It is a commonplace in the present-day US to say that freedom is not free. The conventional view is that this refers to the physical defense of the country when it is attacked by a foreign power. In our view, the cost of freedom includes the boundaries on our individual liberty that are necessary to ensure <em>the system as a whole</em> is able to provide for as much individual liberty as possible on a sustainable basis. This more often means respect for the rights of others than it means physical defense of the territory.
</p>
<p>
Any wild animal will defend its own freedom without regard for the consequences to other animals, and without any understanding of the implications for its own future survival. Americans tend to approach their own freedom in the same way. They have not always done so, but that appears to be the nature of American culture at the time of writing.
</p>
<p>
We assert that a person who sincerely believes in freedom will defend <em>other people's freedom</em>, including that of people who have different beliefs and lifestyles, even at the risk of their own lives. They will rise above the level of a wild animal. Our model builds that into the structure, procedures, and laws of the State, to reduce the likelihood Americans will drift back into an animal-like existence.
