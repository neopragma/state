<h1>Backgrounder on Choices and Consequences</h1>

<p>
	A Backgrounder on this topic is necessary, because the audience for the proposed political model is Americans; and Americans generally do not understand that their choices have natural consequences.

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Freedom of choice is precious to Americans. They want to say and do exactly as they please. Our observation is that when Americans say this, what they really <em>mean</em> is that they want to say and do exactly as they please <em>without any consequences</em>. That is not freedom; it is fantasy. 
</p>
<p>
Our position is that when one makes a choice, one is also choosing the <em>natural consequences</em> of that choice. Natural consequences are those that are attached to the choice itself; they are not optional. For example, a person in need of money might choose to rob a bank. The consequence they want is that they end up with some money. The <em>natural consequence</em> of robbing the bank is that they land in prison. They may think this is "unfair," because they had a different consequence in mind than the one they received. 
</p>
<p>
Consider the story of finding a coin on the ground. You want the coin. It is pretty. What you <em>really</em> want is the side of the coin you can see. It is shiny and bright. You don't know what the other side looks like. When you pick up the coin, you discover the side that was touching the ground is corroded, scratched, and dirty. You don't want it. You only want the shiny side. But that is not realistic. If you want the shiny side, you must take the whole coin.
</p>
<p>
Throughout these documents you may notice an underlying theme - the State does not intrude on many aspects of people's day-to-day lives. It does not attempt to <em>prevent</em> every imaginable "bad thing" from happening. It does not <em>police</em> the population, looking for excuses to issue citations and make arrests. As long as no one complains that you have trampled on their rights, you can do pretty much as you please. 
</p>
<p>
The reason is that we respect Americans' freedom of choice. We have an education system designed to prepare them to make choices with due attention to potential consequences. It is one of the "life skills" we include in the core curriculum to prepare people to become functioning adult members of society. 
</p>
<p>
Even then, some will <em>choose</em> not to pay attention to these lessons. They will receive the natural consequences of the choices they make in life. That is not the State's problem; it is not the duty of the State to guarantee any particular <em>outcomes</em> to people, but only to establish and sustain the <em>conditions</em> in which Americans can live in freedom. 
</p>
<p>
The <em>natural consequence</em> of choosing not to pay attention to life skills lessons in school is that the individual will be more susceptible to making unwise choices going forward. The State offers a robust "safety net" - universal healthcare, guaranteed minimum income, government pension plan - but quality of life will be better than the bare minimum if Americans learn to make wise choices. 
</p>
<p>
Americans say they want <em>freedom</em>. Americans say they want <em>minimal government</em>. Here it is. We hope they will be able to handle it.
</p>

<h2>2. Definitions</h2>

<p>
All Americans have opinions about choices, consequences, individual liberty, and personal responsibility, but there are different conceptions or assumptions about the meaning of these words. In this section, we will attempt to clarify the meanings we have in mind when we explain the philosophical underpinnings of State law.
</p>

<a name="defchoice"/>
<h3>2.1. Choice</h3>

<p>
A <em>choice</em> is a decision one makes when faced with two or more alternative courses of action. The actions one takes on the basis of that choice are the real-world manifestation of the choice. It is the actions, and not the decision as such, that result in consequences. If one takes no action, then the choice amounts to an "opinion" or simply a "thought" and it can do no harm (except in cases when failing to take action to prevent harm leads to harm).
</p>

<a name="defconsequence"/>
<h3>2.2. Consequence</h3>

<p>
A <em>consequence</em> is an outcome that occurs as a result of the actions associated with a choice. A consequence may affect more than one person. Any single action may result in multiple consequences. Depending on the point of view of the person affected by a consequence, it may be positive (or helpful or beneficial), negative (or harmful or costly), or neutral (has no concrete effect on the person).
</p>
<p>
Some consequences are only <em>possible</em> or <em>potential</em> outcomes. For example, the choice to invest money in stocks may result in profit, loss, or no financial change. Other consequences are predictable based on the nature of the action. These are called <em>natural consequences</em>. 
</p>
<p>
In keeping with our philosophy to maximize individual liberty, we expect adults to apprise themselves of the natural consequences of any given choice before taking the action(s) associated with that choice. To ignore the natural consequences of a choice is, itself, a choice that has natural consequences.
</p>
<p>
Natural consequences occur whether you understand them in advance, believe in them, agree with them, feel as if they are fair, or wish they were different. They occur <em>by nature</em>. In a truly free country, where you are free to make choices and expected to bear responsibility for those choices, you cannot complain about the natural consequences of your own freely-chosen actions.
</p>

<h3>2.3. Kindergarten Wisdom</h3>

<p>
It is not necessary for a person to learn statutory law in depth to understand natural consequences. Most people can make a reliable judgment about natural consequences by remembering Kindergarten Wisdom: The principle that one person's rights end where the next person's rights begin. This concept is fundamental to a sustainable society based on individual liberty. If you can foresee that a given action will cause harm to another person, then you know the choice will have negative natural consequences. Should you proceed with the action anyway, you will suffer the consequences.
</p>

<a name="defresp"/>
<h3>2.4. Personal Responsibility</h3>

<p>
Our understanding of the phrase <em>personal responsibility</em> is based on Christopher Avery's "Responsibility Process." It is described in his book, <a href="https://responsibility.com/the-responsibility-process/"><em>The Responsibility Process</em></a>, and used in our <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-american-characteristics.html#avery"><em>Backgrounder on the Characteristics of Americans</em></a> as part of our general assessment of American traits. We mention it again here, in the context of choices and consequences, because we have not observed the majority of Americans applying this level of personal responsibility in their everyday lives. 
</p>
<p>
Due to the cultural importance of individual liberty in America, people living under the State system will not be "protected from themselves" if they make choices that intrude on the liberty of others. Complaining when one receives the natural consequences of one's choices will do no good. It will not be possible to sustain a society based on individual liberty unless the majority of people practice personal responsibility most of the time. If you say you want individual liberty, and you <em>mean</em> it, then we suggest you cultivate the habit of personal responsibility.
</p>
<p>
But that is, of course, your choice to make. Choose your consequences wisely.
</p>

<a name="defreckless"/>
<h3>2.5. The Free Choice of Reckless Action</h3>

<p>
The phrase, <em>free choice of reckless action</em>, has a standard meaning in the context of State law. It applies to dangerous or risky actions people choose to take despite education and clear warnings about the risks. It can mean anything from ignoring safety instructions for using dangerous equipment to engaging in dangerous recreational activities such as sky-diving to threatening violence against law enforcement officers in the process of arrest to entering private property that has warning signs reading "beware of dog" or "electrified fence." The concept is that whatever happens next, even if it would otherwise violate the person's rights under the law, is not an offense because they chose to act recklessly when they should have known better. The concept derives naturally from the idea of maximizing everyone's individual liberty. The idea is that people are free to make bad choices, but they are not protected from the natural consequences of those choices.
</p>


<a name="examples"/>
<h2>3. Examples</h2>

<p>
They say a picture is worth a thousand words. An example is worth, maybe, ten or fifteen abstract definitions.
</p>

<a name="exlibel"/>
<h3>3.1. Defamation</h3>

<p>
<em>Defamation</em> is an attack on the character or reputation of a target individual. <em>Slander</em> is defamation by verbal means, and <em>libel</em> is defamation in print. Libel is generally considered a more serious offense than slander. Defamation is legally actionable under present-day US law, but it can be difficult to prove because everything is based on the letter of the law. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, the spirit of the law prevails over the letter. The first test of whether an offense has been committed is, simply, to ask whether anyone has been harmed. Defamation is actionable under the State system even in the absence of a specific statute that prohibits slander or libel, because an underlying principle of State law is that it is an offense to "cause harm." The philosophy of allowing everyone the maximum possible personal liberty, and expecting them to accept the natural consequences of their choices, means that every conceivable harmful act need not be called out in statutory law.
</p>
<p>
What makes this difference interesting for Americans who enjoy defaming others for fun (for instance, on social media) is that the primacy of the spirit of the law makes it far easier to prosecute cases of defamation. Contrary to some people's assumptions, social media posts are not "verbal" (slander), they are a form of "publication" (libel). 
</p>
<p>
There are countless examples of defamation on social media. People feel free to accuse others of literally anything that sounds bad simply because they assume the other party holds a different political opinion than they. Are you a Republican? Then you are a Nazi. Are you a Democrat? Then you are a Communist. Are you a Catholic or a Southern Baptist? Then you are a pedophile. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, people expressing "opinions" like these would have the opportunity to prove their case in court. They would have more opportunity to do this than they might expect or prefer. 	
</p>
<p>


<a name="excollusion"/>
<h3>3.2. Collusion</h3>

<p>
When two or more parties (usually companies, but possibly individuals) secretly agree to cooperate in some way that gives them both an unfair competitive advantage, they are said to <em>collude</em>. Under the present-day US system, with its emphasis on the letter of the law, every potential act of collusion  - price-fixing, compromised advertising, leaking selected information - must be mentioned in a statute in order to be actionable. Charges of collusion are usually defended on the basis of careful, selective interpretation of the letter of the law. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, the question is whether the cooperation between the two parties resulted in harm to anyone. This is an important difference.
</p>
<p>
The State explicitly declares corporations are <em>not</em> "persons," and explicitly declares incorporation <em>is not</em> a legal shield for the leaders of the corporation. These differences from the present-day US system mean that the individuals who collude will be held legally accountable for the harm their collusion brings to others. It is not necessary for every conceivable form of collusion to be called out explicitly in statutory law. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if two companies privately discuss marketing, product supply levels, or pricing and agree to cooperate in a way that <em>does not</em> bring harm to others, they will not be guilty of collusion. This is in contrast to the present-day US system, in which the <em>act</em> of collusion is a crime, even when no harm is done.
</p>
<p>
In the context of choices and consequences, this means the individuals who make the decisions and direct the actions that bring harm to people will be liable for the damage their choices cause. They would be well-advised to think about natural consequences before taking such action.
</p>

<a name="exstochasticterrorism"/>
<h3>3.3. Stochastic Terrorism</h3>

<p>
In the present-day US, it is illegal to incite violence using any form of communication. Due to the focus on the letter of the law, to be guilty of incitement one must mention a specific target and issue a call to action.
</p>
<p>
Many who have committed acts of violence in recent years cite general political rhetoric as their inspiration. Democrats are routinely referred to as "demon-rats;" pro-abortion rights activists are routinely called "baby-killers;" and so on. Political "analysts" ask questions that are not real questions and connect dots that are not real dots to weave a tapestry of lies intended to foment hatred, to divide Americans against each other, and to generate violence. While they are careful not to mention specific targets or to issue a clear call to action, their words do, in fact, incite violence. 
</p>
<p>
That kind of rhetoric is called <em>stochastic terrorism</em>. The online dictionary, dictionary.com, defines the term as "the public demonization of a person or group resulting in the incitement of a violent act, which is statistically probable but whose specifics cannot be predicted." The word <em>stochastic</em> means (approximately) "random," and the word <em>terrorism</em> in this context means "violence motivated by ideology."
</p>
<p>
In the present-day US system, rhetoric intended to incite random violence is not defined as a crime by the letter of the law. Under the State system, we would ask whether any harm was done. If so, then it is a crime. In this case, violence inspired by rhetoric would violate basic human rights - the very first human right enumerated in State law: the right to live. Thus, the <em>nature</em> of the harm rises to the level of a Category 1 crime: Egregious. The <em>extent</em> of the harm could increase the severity of the crime, if more than one victim were harmed. Then, the attitude of the perpetrator would come into consideration regarding appropriate punishment. 
</p>
<p>
The intent to divide Americans against each other undermines the Three Pillars of Independence. That is another factor that increases the severity of stochastic terrorism under the State system. Those convicted of this offense could face multiple, lengthy prison sentences to be served sequentially.
</p>
<p>
Politicians, news analysts, and individuals with a significant social media following are advised to educate themselves about the concepts of choice and consequences and personal responsibility.
