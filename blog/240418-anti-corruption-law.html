This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Anti-Corruption Law</h1>

<p>
    18 April 2024
</p>

<p>
    The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) is considering the case of James Snyder, a mayor from Indiana who awarded contracts to a trucking company and later asked the company for money. They paid Snyder $13,000 for "consulting services" which he never provided. Snyder was prosecuted under 18 US Code 666, "Theft or bribery concerning programs receiving Federal funds."
</p>
<p>
    SCOTUS has been under public scrutiny for the past several years for questionable actions and decisions. They often seem to be protecting corrupt officials rather than protecting the public <em>from</em> corrupt officials. Although the Court has been stacked by the Republicans, it isn't clear that they have abused their position in this way. In the Snyder case, the wording of the statute leaves quite a bit of wiggle room for interpretation.
</p>
<p>
    The wording in question is in paragraph (a)(1)(B) of the statute, which reads, "...corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more;..."
</p>
<p>
    The meaning of the word, <em>corruptly</em>, is the point of contention in the case. There's an old saying, "I don't know art, but I know what I like." The word <em>corruptly</em> is like that. It's imprecise, and there is merit to the idea that SCOTUS should examine the statute. 
</p>
<p>
    Even so, there's a question of whether SCOTUS is using the case as an opportunity to weaken anti-corruption protection for the American people. In an interview with counsel on the Snyder case, Justice Neil Gorsuch wondered, "how does anyone in the real world know the line" between acceptable gifts and bribery? The comment raises a red flag. It is as if Justice Gorsuch is pretending he can't smell his own farts. 
</p>
<p>
    The Justice brought the Real World® into the discussion. Fine. The private sector is more real than the government, and the private sector is not confused about what constitutes corruption or bribery. Nearly every corporation has rules for employees to follow whenever they find themselves in a situation that <em>may</em> involve corruption, even if it just "smells wrong" to them. Typically, the rule is to leave the room immediately without saying anything, and to report the incident to management. Better safe than sorry. In the Real World®, no one wants to invite even the slightest suspicion of corruption. Everyone in the Real World® knows "the line."
</p>
<p>
    We suspect Justice Gorsuch knows the line, too. Perhaps what smells like a fart to regular people smells like <em>opportunity</em> to...well, to a <em>certain type</em> of person.
