This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Vehicular Homicide</h1>

<p>
    18 September 2023
</p>

<p>
Two cases in particular, among many others, illustrate a key difference between the State's approach to criminal prosecution and the existing legal system in the United States. 
</p>
<p>
One is the case of a Marietta, Georgia woman who was crossing the street with her kids (on foot) when her four-year-old was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver. She, and not the driver, was convicted of vehicular manslaughter because they were not in a crosswalk at the time. The case stirred a great deal of emotion on social media. 
</p>
<p>
The other is an incident in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in which an off-duty police officer was driving his Corvette at 94 miles per hour when he struck an SUV and killed a one-year-old girl who was a passenger in the SUV. The girl's mother was charged with negligent homicide for failing to secure her daughter properly in a child seat. The officer was not charged and was never penalized for killing the child.
</p>
<p>
Both these cases had mitigating circumstances that led courts to find multiple parties partly to blame for the deaths, and to be uncertain who should be charged with what. 
</p>
<p>
In the present-day US system, these situations are often assessed on the basis of who you are and what actions you took or failed to take. Are you a police officer? Accountability is unlikely. Are you black? They will find something to charge you with. Were you in a designated crosswalk? If not, then (apparently) cars are more important than your children's lives. Was your child killed by a speeding driver? Then you should have been more careful.
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
The guiding principle of the State's legal code is that the spirit of the law supersedes the letter of the law. In the US, the letter of the law is all that matters - apart from the wiggle room afforded certain people of privilege. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, personal responsibility for the consequences of your actions falls to you; it's the reverse side of the "individual liberty" coin. The definition of an "offense" is that someone was offended, and the severity of the offense depends on how much harm you caused.
</p>
<p>
The question isn't "did you do this?" or "did you fail to do that?" With individual liberty as the foundation of the State, everyone of majority age is expected to understand life well enough to consider the potential natural consequences of any action they choose to take, and they are fully responsible for those choices. 
</p>
<p>
Cars should never have more rights than humans, so in the Marietta case we would not convict the mother for crossing a street. But any mother knows the importance of securing children in car seats, so in the Baton Rouge case the mother would share a small portion of the blame, if in fact it were determined that she had failed to secure the car seat properly. Publicly-available information about the case does not make that clear; it may only be a claim made by the defense. But in neither case did the mother kill her own child, and in neither case was the killer held to account. They would not get away with this under the State system.
</p>
<p>
Want to drive your Corvette at 94 miles per hour in town? Go ahead. There are no speed limits. Just be sure you don't kill someone, because if you do the system will come down on you like a ton of bricks. You will pay for the damage and harm you caused. Even if you're a law enforcement officer, an elected official, or belong to the "right" family. 
</p>
<p>
What matters is the harm you cause - not who you are, what your job is, your skin color, or whether you know how to exploit a loophole in the letter of the law.
</p>
<p>
That said, in both these cases the mothers were partially to blame. But we're talking about 5% of the blame or less. In both these cases, the killer paid little or nothing for the privilege of killing a child - six months in one case, no penalty at all in the other.
</p>
<p>
We believe we can do better than this. We hope Americans on the whole can do better, too.
