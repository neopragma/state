This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Mississippi Racism</h1>

<p>
    30 March 2024
</p>

<p>
	The case of the six Mississippi deputies, calling themselves the 'Goon Squad,' who routinely harrassed and assaulted Black citizens and ultimately went too far for their own good in January, 2023, raises deeper questions about the culture of the people of Mississippi. The larger problem isn't the actions of the six on that one occasion, considered in isolation. It's a question of the culture of white Mississipians; a profoundly racist and violent culture that has deep historical roots.
</p>
<p>
	The Goon Squad attacked the men in their own home because a white neighbor called in a complaint - two Black men were living in the same house as a white woman. So, the neighbor is also guilty of racism and hate. The neighbor was raised by parents, teachers, and clergy in a community. So, the community is also guilty of racism and hate. The community is part of a town, a county, a state. So, the state is also guilty of racism and hate. It is a state with an absolutely unconscionable history with respect to race.
</p>
<p>
	Mississippi was founded as a slave state. Most white people there did not consider Africans to be fully human. It seems many, if not most, still don't. Notwithstanding 20th- and 21st-century protestations that the secession was about "states' rights," the <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_missec.asp">Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union</a> cites the preservation of the institution of slavery as <em>the only reason</em> for secession. They feared the Lincoln administration would make slavery illegal in all states. They weren't having it. In this, they were no different from the other states that seceded - <a href="https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states"><em>all</em> cited slavery as <em>the only reason to secede</em></a>.
</p>
<p>
	Since then, Mississippi and the other former slave states have seen countless horrific acts of violence against Blacks. Everyday expressions of racial hatred, both on an individual and an institutional level, range from dirty looks in public to redlining to inferior schools to suppression of voting rights to church bombings and lynchings. As recently as this decade, white Mississippians have threatened to murder Black Sentators and Congressmen, elected by the majority-Black voters. Whites in the state still celebrate their "heritage" and proudly wave the flag of sedition, racism, and slavery: the Confederate battle flag. 
</p>
<p>
	There is no place in the new America for this. The basis of the American State is human rights. The goal is to establish a system that enables individual liberty, but that liberty must be exercised according to the principle of upholding everyone's human rights. 
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    Under the State system, local and regional law enforcement duties are handled by subordinate operating units of the single, national law enforcement administration. That structure makes such incidents less likely than under the US system, in which local police and sheriff departments can operate largely autonomously. Yet, anything is possible.
</p>
<p>
    The behavior of the Goon Squad amounts to violation of fundamental human rights. That is a Category 1 offense in State law. The individuals would not be protected by their membership in a law enforcement organization. In fact, if there were any attempt at a cover-up, all those involved in the cover-up would be prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>
    Due to the extremely heinous nature of the crimes, it is possible a court would order an investigation into the law enforcement agency where the officers worked, or had worked in the past. If compelling evidence of systematic corruption were discovered, or if a consistent pattern of racism in training or in the organizational culture were discovered, the State might "clean house" by replacing most or all employees.
