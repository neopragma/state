<h1>Attempted Assassination of a US Citizen by the Government of India</h1>

<p>
    23 May 2024
</p>
    
<p>
    Following the June, 2023 murder of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ramped up the rhetoric at his political rallies. He speaks openly of killing "enemies" of India in their homes, anywhere in the world, to the accompaniment of thousands of cheering supporters. He says that "enemies" must now "think 100 times" before doing anything against India, and that "enemies" tremble when there is a strong government in India. Criticizing the former Congress government as "soft" on Pakistan-based terrorists, he says his government will not deliver a "dossier" to Pakistan, they will deliver a "dose" instead. 
</p>
<p>    
    The US suspects Modi of masterminding the attempted murder of another Sikh activist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is a US citizen living in New York. Pannun describes himself as an activist who supports the establishment of an independent Sikh state, which separatists call Khalistan. India describes him as a terrorist, and asserts the right to go after terrorists who attack India regardless of where they live. 
</p>
<p>
    To be fair, India has not suddenly decided to run around killing people helter-skelter. They've suffered from terror attacks from internal non-Hindu groups for decades. Tensions between Hindus and Sikhs reached its hottest point in 1984, when the Indian Army launched Operation Blue Star to remove certain Sikh separatists from the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in Sikhism. 
</p>
<p>
    Operation Blue Star turned into a military battle when the Sikhs responded to the Army with rocket-propelled grenades and armor-piercing anti-tank weapons. The Army escalated from light arms to tanks, artillery, and helicopters. The operation achieved its objective, but at high cost to Hindu-Sikh relations. 
</p>
<p>
    Making matters worse, India followed up with sweeping police actions in Punjab targeting Sikh civilians. They slaughtered thousands. This overkill directly led to the assassination of Indira Gandhi.
</p>
<p>
    Operation Blue Star goes to show how the victim of terrorism can take their response beyond the point of diminishing returns. We're seeing the same with Israel's response to the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas, and we (Americans) also responded to the 9-11 attacks with excessive military force that extended to decades-long foreign occupations. India is receiving the same sort of backlash, and they want to put a stop to it.  
</p>
<h3>Assassination, targeted killing, or simple murder?</h3>
<p>
    Many people over many years have pondered the legal and ethical implications of killing "enemies" when the parties in conflict are not formally at war. There are quite a few references at the bottom of this page, and they are only a small sampling. 
</p>
<p>
    Much of the material focuses on the definitions of the terms "assassination" and "targeted killing." The tone of many articles suggests the goal of the studies isn't to arrive at an objective and consistent definition, but rather to find some way, however tenuous and self-serving, to justify the deliberate killing of civilians by national governments and militaries.
</p>
<p>
    It certainly "feels" wrong for a terrorist to kill people and then go and hide in another country. In fact, India has accused Canada of harboring Sikh terrorists deliberately, to the detriment of international relations. When the US located Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, the Pakistani government did not appear to be harboring him intentionally. Even so, the US did not request extradition and did not inform Pakistan before undertaking a covert operation to kill him in his home - the same tactic Indian PM Modi advocates. 
</p>
<h3>Is Pannun a terrorist or merely an opposition figure?</h3>
<p>
    You might say Modi and the Indian government are justified in targeting known terrorist leaders. Terrorism is one form of asymmetrical warfare, and conventional battlefield tactics are ineffective against it.
</p>
<p>
    But it's unclear whether Pannun qualifies as a terrorist. India claims he has encouraged acts of terrorism, and even funded them. He insists he advocates for Sikh separatism, but has not engaged in, encouraged, or paid for violence. The matter seems to be in a gray area. 
</p>
<p>
    That's a problem. Most people would agree that it's best to get rid of genuine terrorists without worrying about exactly where they're holed up. But what about a critic who speaks and writes but is never involved in violence? What about a social media influencer? What about an ordinary person who happens to belong to the "wrong" nationality or religion? 
</p>
<p>
    It's a slipperly slope, and PM Modi has stepped firmly onto it. At the bottom of the slope is a world operated by tribal warlords dressed up as heads of state, repeatedly sending assassins after each other; a world where no ordinary person is safe in their own home.
</p>
<p>
    One question we must ask ourselves is whether we want tit-for-tat assassination to become an accepted norm of international relations. Our answer is "no" for reasons we hope are too obvious to require explanation. 
</p>
<h3>How can the US respond?</h3>
<p>
    For more than one reason, it's difficult for the US to counter an open-ended, ongoing threat of targeted killings of Americans by foreign governments. 
</p>
<p>
    First, the practical challenges are immense. They include identifying every government and non-governmental organization that might wish to kill an American, and which Americans they want dead; understanding the rationale for the killings based on alien thinking and barbaric values; anticipating who is likely to carry out such an act; interdicting the operations; and bringing the perpetrators to justice in a way that avoids triggering broader international conflict. It seems highly probable that many such attempts would succeed, even if some were foiled. 
</p>
<p>
    A second challenge is that the US today lacks a policy similar to our Three Pillars of Independence. Taking strong action against India would incur high costs to the US. The same is true with respect to China and several other foreign countries with whom we have deep and complicated economic entanglements. 
</p>
<p>
    Some of these entanglements are circular in bizarre ways. For instance, we sell Russia uranium. They use it in their energy sector, but they also refine it to produce nuclear weapons that target...us. 
</p>
<p>
    This is exactly the reason for the Three Pillars of Independence - without them, we aren't truly <em>independent</em>. We must compromise on our principles, and even compromise on our obligation to protect our citizens, when we have hard dependencies on a foreign country.
</p>
<p>
    US policy <em>appears</em> to be partly based on the assumption that certain countries are friendly while others are hostile, and it's unthinkable for a friendly country to launch a covert assassination operation on US soil. That approach leaves us vulnerable to unpleasant surprises. Any country might be friendly on Monday and hostile on Tuesday. We can't count on anyone except ourselves. As long as a foreign partner acts in accord with our formal agreements, all is well; but we must not open ourselves for surprises.
</p>
<p>
    A third challenge is the shift in global alliances and balance of power currently underway. It's unclear how things will end up once they stabilize. However, at the moment there seems to be a group of countries (the BRICS countries) that includes four significant economic and military powers, all aligned against the US. Present US diplomatic strategy is to try to establish positive working relationships with them individually, so that they will not become an unbreakable block. 
</p>
<p>
    The US sees the democratic BRICS members as potential mitigators of the bloc's general anti-Western bias. As a fellow democracy, India may have at least <em>some</em> affinity for the US system, or so we hope. The US does not want to push India into the arms of Russia or China. 
</p>
<p>
    The good news is that India does not wish to become anyone's client state. They have tried to balance relations with China, Russia, and the US and to maintain a largely neutral international position without submitting to anyone. The US government has to tread carefully lest the US response to the assassination attempt upsets this balance and plays into the hands of the authoritarian BRICS members.
</p>
<p>
    A fourth challenge comes down to a facet of American culture ingrained in us from childhood: Who has "room to talk" and who doesn't? The US has carried out targeted killings of individuals in various foreign countries without warning and without regard for the targets' nationality, citizenship, or physical location. When it happens on our own soil, what grounds have we to complain? 
</p>
<p>
    We don't see this as a weakness. Barbarians don't introspect in this way. They never worry about whether they have "room to talk." This is a positive feature of American culture, but we mustn't let it hinder our response to threats.
</p>
<p>
    The vast majority of Americans may well assume the issue can't affect them, as they are not Sikh separatists. The larger problem is that if India gets a free pass on this, then any and every other country will feel free to target any Americans for any reason whatsoever. Once we allow that to happen, it will be all but impossible to correct it. Therefore, India's program of international assassination must be stopped cold.
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of this blog is not to solve immediate problems like the matter in question, but to explore how the American State might operate differently than the present-day US when faced with similar challenges. We've thought about the factors the US government may be considering in real life. Now let's turn to a hypothetical future in which the American State has already been established, and see how the response might differ.
</p>
<p>
    If we presume the attempted assassination occurs after the creation of the American State, then some of the circumstances would differ from the actual case. We use the present tense in reference to that hypothetical future world. 
</p>
<p>
    The State has established different laws, policies, and international relationships than the United States. Some of these differences affect the way America can handle the situation. 
</p>
<p>
    We have no skin in the Hindu-Sikh game. We neither support nor oppose the establishment of a separate Sikh state. Our response to the attempted assassination is based on the fact that the target is an American citizen and the perpetrator is a foreign government. That's all. We don't care why they want to kill him. No foreign actor is permitted to kill an American citizen at home. Period.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, we do not intend to become a haven for terrorists. There is a civilized way to handle it. We expect the Indian government to request extradition of any American citizens or residents they believe are involved with terrorist activity in India, and to provide enough evidence to make our government believe the accusation is credible. Then we can proceed with extradition if appropriate. For the Indian government simply to launch a covert operation to murder an American citizen is unacceptable.  
</p>
<p>
    The State has the duty to establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can exercise individual liberty to the fullest extent practical. In addition, the Constitution enumerates several basic human rights which we consider inviolable. The first among these is simply the right to live. 
</p>
<p>
    The assassination attempt, and more broadly the Indian government's assassination <em>policy</em>, by which they assert the right and the intention to kill anyone they please in any country, is an assault on the system that enables human rights and individual liberty for Americans. As such, it meets the definition of an <em>existential threat</em> under State law. It is our policy not to tolerate an existential threat.
</p>
<p>
    The State is free to respond differently from the present-day United States for three key reasons.
</p>
<p>
    First, the Three Pillars of Independence enable us to act according to our principles without the need to compromise due to hard dependencies on foreign suppliers of any basic needs. There may be <em>some</em> cost to us in breaking commercial relations with India, but not a <em>debilitating</em> cost. 
</p>
<p>
    By design, the American State is self-sufficient in food, energy, and defense. We welcome imports because imports make life better for Americans, but we do not <em>need</em> them. No one has leverage over us. Halting imports will harm the supplier far more than it will harm us. For the same reason, any such halt in commerce will be temporary. Suppliers need access to the American market. There is almost no one else on the planet who can purchase their export goods in quantity.
</p>
<p>
    Second, State law protects American workers by requiring a high percentage of employees and contractors of any business operating in America to be American citizens. One consequence of this policy is that the number of Indian expatriates working in US-based tech companies will be substantially smaller than the number in the present-day US. 
</p>
<p>
    The process of instituting the new labor laws will have soured relations with India to an extent. The key difference is that we have no particular dependency on India for IT labor. The American State need not dance around the problem in the way the United States has had to do. We can do whatever is necessary to end the threat definitively.
</p>
<p>
    Third, we see long-term value in cultivating a more positive working relationship with China than does the present-day US government. Philosophical differences inherited from the Cold War era are irrelevant. The internal policies of China have no effect on the ability of Americans to exercise individual liberty in their own country. In this hypothetical future, the State has a closer relationship with China than it has with India.
</p>
<p>
    Our philosophy is that stability is key, and that peace is a natural outcome of stability plus trade. The combined value of the Chinese and American national economies exceeds the value of any other country or economic union by a considerable margin. Together, we completely dominate the global economy. As partners, we can assure global stability, suppress nascent wars, and sponsor economic development around the world. As adversaries, all we can accomplish is to destroy things, probably including each other. The partnership has tremendous value to both countries...certainly more than their respective relationships with India.
</p>
<p>
    Practical-minded as they are, the Chinese will not incur high risks or give up a high value relationship in order to back India against America in a hot war, even though both China and India are members of the BRICS group. They might even see an opportunity to take advantage of a distracted and weakened India to take control of border territories in dispute between the two countries. Pakistan, Iran, and Russia might see opportunities, too. In this world, India has a lot to consider before they start deploying assassins.
</p>
<p>
    We can influence policy change in India to end the assassination program or, at a minimum, ensure it is never directed at Americans. If India persists, we can take stronger action to protect our people with no additional downside. The risks to India should we treat the matter as an act of war rather than a diplomatic issue gives them further reason to reconsider the policy.
</p>
<p>
    The situation is a good example of how the State system puts America in a stronger position than the present-day system.
