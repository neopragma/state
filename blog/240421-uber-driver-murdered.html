This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Uber Driver Murdered</h1>

<p>
    21 April 2024
</p>

<p>
    The case of an elderly man who shot and killed an Uber driver outside his Ohio home is deeply tragic, but also provides an example of how the State's approach to crime and punishment would differ from the present-day approach in the US. 
</p>
<p>
    In a nutshell, it seems a scammer had phoned the old man to say that a relative of his had been arrested and needed $12,000 to post bond. He had been on the phone with the scammer for two hours when an Uber arrived at his door. The driver said she had been sent to pick up a package. 
</p>
<p>
    The old man assumed she was there to collect the money. He held her at gunpoint and demanded to know the identities of her accomplices. She had no idea what he was talking about. They argued, and when all was said and done he had shot her three times with a .22 pistol. The third shot was a "finishing" shot - impossible to defend as accidental or as justifiable. 
</p>
<p>
    It turns out that the scammer had summoned an Uber to go to the old man's house. Uber is cooperating with police in the matter, but so far (21 April 2024) the scammer has not been identified. The old man has pleaded not guilty to murder. 
</p>

<h3>What are the implications under the current US system?</h3>

<p>
    In many US states today it is legal to defend one's life and property with deadly force. In this case, the homeowner was not legitimately defending his own life or his property when he killed the Uber driver. He has been charged with murder. He has pleaded not guilty.
</p>
<p>
    It is also legal to attempt to scam people out of money. The only action authorities take is to try and raise awareness of common scams and advise people to pay attention when their personal information has been compromised, and to be sceptical of those claiming to be police or other authority figures. Police and government agencies do not contact anyone to collect money by telephone or text messages or email. And they certainly don't use Uber to pick up payments.
</p>

<h3>Differences between the two legal systems with respect to this case</h3>

<p>
    The key difference between the two systems is that the US system defines an offense as an action that is not approved in the legal code, while the State system defines an offense as anything that causes harm to one or more people even if the specific action is not mentioned explicitly in the legal code. 
</p>
<p>
    The State's legal code also defines a series of "tests" to help ensure the punishment fits the crime. That point is relevant in this comparison because under the US system there are no implications for the man to plead not guilty. In fact, to navigate the current legal system anyone accused of anything is well advised to plead not guilty. 
</p>
<p>
    Under the State system the perpetrator's "attitude" during the investigation and trial are considered in sentencing. A State court might consider a not guilty plea to have been an attempt to "wiggle out of" responsibility for the offense. In case of conviction, this could increase the severity of the sentence. 
</p>
<p>
    Both systems specify the presumption of innocence prior to a conviction. If anything, the State has stronger protections for the accused in this regard than the US system. One consideration when defining the State's legal code was the fact that the US system results in a large number of false convictions, and we wanted to try and build in some protections against that. So, under the State system, when it's really clear that the accused <em>did</em> commit the crime, there's no value to them in pretending they didn't, as doing so will affect sentencing.
</p>
<p>
    As we reason through the ways in which the case might be handled differently, we need to keep in mind that the accused in this case is compelled to play a very different "game" with respect to his plea than he would under the State system. We can't assume his plea is an attempt to avoid responsibility. He knows what he did; there is no mystery to be solved here.
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    First, let's acknowledge the things that would be the same under both systems. The most obvious is probably the fact there is no chance at all for justice to be served in this case. The victim was alone and terrified, held at gunpoint against her will, with the killer screaming at her about things she knew nothing about, before he viciously slaughtered her, not bothering to validate his assumptions. There is no form of compensation and no degree of punishment for the killer that would bring peace to the victim's family and friends, and no magic that could restore her to life. Even if any form of atonement were possible, the killer was 81 years old at the time of the murder. He won't live long enough to do enough Good Works to make a difference. None of that can be fixed by changing the legal system or the approach to law enforcement. The injustice of this case is absolutely infuriating.
</p>
<p>
    The initial response to the call by law enforcement would also be largely the same under the State system. In the event, the killer called 9-1-1 to report that he had shot someone who was trying to rob him. That would be the same under the State system. Officers were dispatched to the scene. That would be the same, as well, except for where the officers were dispatched <em>from</em>. 
</p>
<p>
    Under the US system, police actively patrol civilian areas looking for trouble. When a call comes in, dispatch broadcasts to all patrols and one that is near the location responds. Under the State system, officers would be dispatched from a law enforcement facility in the town, because there are no active police patrols (unless there is a special event - a parade, a political rally, a protest march, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    The killer was charged with murder. That would be the same under the State system. Uber cooperated with law enforcement to identify the Uber account that had requested the car. The assumption is that account belonged to one of the perpetrators of the scam. One assumes Uber would cooperate with law enforcement under the State system, too. 
</p>
<p>
    The case has not yet gone through the entire legal process. We can assume both systems would prosecute the killer for murder. One possible difference is that the death penalty exists under US law, but not under State law. The maximum penalty would be life imprisonment, and at his age that won't be very long. 
</p>
<p>
    We think the biggest difference is how the authorities would deal with the perpetrators of the scam. Under the US system, they are guilty only of specific actions that are prohibited under the legal code. For the most part, scams are completely legal. At least, on a practical level they are rarely (never?) prosecuted and there has been no effective action to shut down that sort of activity generally. The authorities are OK with scams. They might not appreciate hearing that, but their behavior tells us so. 
</p>
<p>
    Under the State system, the only "crime" is to do harm. The State is all about individual liberty, so as long as you aren't doing harm to anyone except yourself, you're "good to go." In this case, the perpetrators of the scam caused a great deal of harm. They would be considered as guilty as the shooter. It's unlikely any of them would ever see the light of day again.
</p>
<p>
    Another difference is how his licensed handgun would be managed under the State system. He would have to be checked for mental and emotional competence as well as for competent physical handling of the weapon on a regular basis; probably every five years or so, depending on how the responsible regulatory organization defined the rules. Given his mental state at the time of the incident, all indications are he would not have passed such a check-up. He would have been unable to shoot anyone, except with his finger.
</p>
<p>
    We can't predict what penalties will apply in the actual case, but under the State system there would be another set of victims: The perpetrator's family. Whatever portion of his estate might have gone to them after his death would go instead to compensate the family of the murder victim. This is another form of harm the killer caused. This consideration would also increase the penalties for the perpetrators of the scam. It seems unlikely that would occur under the present US system.
</p>

<h3>Are age or mental health mitigating factors?</h3>

<p>
    Elderly people often fall prey to scams, even if they would have known better when they were in the prime of life. The story of the shiny coin applies here, as it so often does in a system based on individual liberty <em>with the personal responsibility that goes with it</em>. If the man were not able to live independently, he should not have been living independently. Under the State system, he would be treated as fully responsible for his own actions; he would be <em>required</em> to understand that this very, very obvious scam was just a scam. 
</p>
<p>
    If he were losing the ability to understand that, then his family or other caregivers should have arranged for some form of assisted living for him. He and his family <em>freely chose</em> to have him living independently. Under the present US system, the family may not be able to afford assisted living for their elderly relative, but under the State system everyone receives a pension. Full personal responsibility is the other side of the coin of individual liberty, like it or not. It is even possible they could be judged to have been partially responsible for the murder, as a result of failing in their duties to their elderly relative. 
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the State is not <em>necessarily</em> to be "nice" to everyone. The purpose is to ensure the maximum number of Americans can enjoy the maximum degree of individual liberty on a sustainable basis. This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated or excused.
