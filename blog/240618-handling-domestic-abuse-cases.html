<h1>Handling Domestic Abuse Cases</h1>

<p>
    18 June 2024
</p>

<p>
    If enacted, Oklahoma SB 1470 will allow domestic abuse circumstances to be given in evidence at trials of victims accused of murdering their abusive partners, and will allow those already incarcerated to petition the state (Oklahoma only) for resentencing to reduce their terms in light of such evidence in their cases.
</p>
<p>
    For context, Oklahoma is considered the "worst" US state for women, with many more documented cases of domestic abuse and many more women in prison for defending themselves against their abusers than any other US state, as well as a history of ignoring mitigating circumstances when convicting and sentencing such women. 
</p>
<p>
    For this law to be proposed in that particular state and to have passed the legislature is remarkable. It demonstrates that a significant number of decent people live there and want to see the situation improve.
</p>
<p>
    Public announcement of SB 1470 has brought the issue of domestic abuse into the foreground of general discussion in the US. This is a good topic for exploring differences between the present-day US system and the proposed American State system. 
</p>
<p>
    In this post, we'll consider the situation in Oklahoma as well as the overall situation in the US with respect to the issue. The subject touches on several differences between the current and proposed systems of government.
</p>

<h3>American cultural factors - background</h3>

<p>
    The subject of women in abusive situations who are severely punished for acts of self-defense is part of a larger problem with misogyny baked deeply into American culture. Misogyny is reflected in the law as well as in the standard procedures and management styles of corporations. To compare the American State's strategy to deal with the problem with that of the present-day US requires us to broaden the scope of our observations beyond the Oklahoma bill currently in the headlines. Let's begin by setting the context of misogyny in US culture.
</p>
<p>
    It is an understatement to say the US has a male-dominated culture. Social justice warriors and other concerned people use the term "the patriarchy" to refer to the totality of ingrained cultural values, unexamined assumptions, Biblical interpretations, legal statutes, administrative procedures, law enforcement failures, Supreme Court rulings, unequal representation in government, historical difficulties women have experienced in exercising voting rights, and discrimination in education, housing, employment, compensation, career advancement, lending, healthcare, insurance, launching business ventures, and other matters.  
</p>
<p>
    Not to belabor the point, but we regard the word "patriarchy" as too soft to describe the level of male domination in the culture. We would go so far as to say the US has a <em>rape culture</em> no different from those of countries that appear in the headlines relatively frequently for horrific rape cases, such as India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, among others. That is the level at which the US system operates (on the whole) with respect to women.
</p> 
<p>
    Police, whom people <em>should</em> be able to rely on for protection, often offer leniency to female suspects in exchange for sexual favors. One of the most dangerous things that can happen to an American woman is to be stopped by a police officer for a traffic violation. Women who are arrested are subject to rape by police officers and guards, and have no practical recourse. 
</p>
<p>
    In some jurisdictions, the police have ongoing arrangements with sex workers not to arrest or investigate them provided they service police officers on request. In all jurisdictions we know of, prosecution for prostitution focuses on the women and girls who are used. Neither the customers nor the pimps are prosecuted, in most cases. 
</p>
<p>
    Sex trafficking, including child sex trafficking, rarely reaches the headlines although it remains an ongoing problem. The society as a whole seems to accept it as normal. Law enforcement always finds something more urgent to attend to.
</p>
<p>
    The point of contact for assistance in cases of domestic abuse is the police department, who often ignore or underplay reports by women while acting swiftly in support of men involved in the abusive situations. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that police departments are not required to enforce restraining orders against abusive men, leaving their victims without even minimal protection. 
</p>
<p>
    The Court would never have heard that case unless police departments had complained about having to enforce restraining orders; therefore, the very fact the Court has ruled on this question tells us police departments are not interested in protecting women from violence. Indeed, they would rather spend their limited resources filing complaints with the courts than on protecting victims of domestic abuse. One is compelled to wonder what personal vested interest police officers - and entire police departments - may have in allowing abusers to run free. 
</p>
<p>
    Officers who abuse women are rarely prosecuted. Some exceptions are noted in the references below. For every case that reaches a courtroom, we must wonder how many offenses are never reported due to fear of retribution. 
</p>
<p>
    As the "conservative" movement gains traction, more and more states are passing misogynistic laws denying basic human rights and healthcare options to women. 
</p>
<p>
    Misogyny has a long history in the US, predating the official launch of the nation-state in the 1780s. Most historical victims will never be identified, but we do know of one famous case - Sarah "Sally" Hemings, a girl with 25% African blood who was inherited by Thomas Jefferson from his father-in-law, John Wayles. He began using her when she was around 14 years old, and impregnated her multiple times. 
</p>
<p>
    We can only speculate, but it seems likely Jefferson's choice of Hemings was based more on convenience than on racism, since she was considered under the law to be a piece of property. Perhaps he found her attractive because she was far more white than black. She was, however, black enough to be enslaved. It also seems likely he made use of other enslaved women and girls. Despite his inspirational writing about freedom, he never took the logical step of denying this privilege to himself. 
</p>
<p>
    Rape of enslaved women and girls was very common prior to the Civil War. There are countless reports of girls and women being passed from one white man to the next, sometimes as part of a "deal" to trade for pigs and chickens or other goods, and sometimes for no particular reason at all. Many enslaved women bore over 20 children during their lifetimes, nearly all of which were the result of rape by white men.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the civil rights movement in the 1960s, a practice known as <em>nighttime integration</em> was common throughout the country - not only in areas that had practiced chattel slavery in the 19th century. White men and boys would visit homes in Black neighborhoods and demand sex from any and all women and girls they pleased. There was no legal recourse for the victims, and no practical actions they could take individually or as a community against the practice. 
</p>
<p>
    We mention the plight of enslaved women and girls because the institution of slavery put them in a position where they had no defense against their abusers; but sexual abuse and general discrimination were common experiences for most women in America from colonial times onward. It is often said that today around 25% of women in the US were sexually abused when they were minors. 
</p>
<p>
    Abigail Adams, the wife of US founder John Adams, wrote to her husband on March 31, 1776, when he was meeting with the Continental Congress (women were not welcome to participate). According to History.com, she wrote: 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:24px">
    "I long to hear that you have declared an independency. And, by the way, in the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation."
</p>
<p>
    The men laughed it off. No such rebellion has happened to date. 
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes a news report highlights the cultural undercurrent of misogyny. Former President Donald Trump carried out a sexually explicit conversation that was recorded, probably without his knowledge. One comment he made during the conversation referred to grabbing women by the pussy. It was a passing remark and not the crux of the conversation, but the comment took on a life of its own in the public imagination. 
</p>
<p>
    Interviewing Trump supporters at one of his rallies, a reporter asked people what they thought of it. Some replied that all men wished they could grab women by the pussy and get away with it. For them, it was the primary reason they admired Trump and they didn't care if he were convicted of felonies. Others laughed. Of course, that is only an anecdote, but it is an indicator of deeply-ingrained cultural values. How can women achieve fair treatment in a society where the men think and speak in that manner when they don't know they're being observed or recorded?
</p>
<p>
    In some parts of the US, local culture conflates enthusiasm for football with misogyny and child abuse in a bizarre and disturbing way. In many small towns in the upper midwest and possibly other regions, the pinnacle of civic life is high school football. Nothing much happens there except games between rival towns. Locals have little to aspire to after high school, which many remember as the best years of their lives. 
</p>
<p>
    Members of the local high school football team are treated as a weird combination of rockstars and deities. An aspect of this culture is that high school girls are expected to provide sexual services to any and all football players. Occasionally a news item reaches the national level describing a case when a girl or her parents file charges against football team members for rape only to be vilified and threatened with death by the townspeople. One simply does not accuse the football team of <em>anything</em>. They are, after all, the <em>football team</em>. Why don't the girls and their parents embrace traditional American values?
</p>
<p>
    The rape culture of football continues into college and professional sports. One of the references cites a news report of a gang-rape case in which San Diego football players raped a then-underage girl (aged 17) at a party. The case is cited as a general example of a common occurrence in the US. 
</p>
<p>
    Mainstream, middle-class, white, Protestant women in the US are subject to discrimination, daily misogynistic microaggressions, and direct physical assault to such an extent that the behavior must be recognized as characteristic of American culture, and not anomalous. Women who find themselves in the US under circumstances that make it hard for them to enjoy equal treatment under the law, as per the Constitution, are at even higher risk. 
</p>
<p>
    We are reminded of a report from about 25 years ago (not online as far as we know) of a Mexican migrant worker employed to pick crops. She was 32 years old and had an 11-year-old daughter to support as a single parent. On payday, her employer required her to perform oral sex for him before he would hand over her paycheck. Actually, he dropped the check on the floor and laughed at her as she crawled after it. This sort of thing was reportedly common at the time. 
</p>
<p>
    We believe this was another matter of convenience rather than racism; she was in a situation that gave her employer overwhelming power over her. We suspect the employer would have been pleased to abuse the blue-eyed blonde wife of his neighbor if he knew he could get away with it. As Abigail Adams wrote, "all men would be tyrants if they could." Migrant workers were often undocumented and thus unprotected by the law. Those in the country legally were still abused by employers and had little or no recourse. We do not know the present extent of the problem.
</p>
<p>
    Both legislators and tech companies that see themselves as above the law have been systematically eroding or overturning women's healthcare rights, particularly (but not limited to) abortion rights. A recent report from Amnesty International cites social media platforms deleting or flagging as inappropriate any information whatsoever about abortion, including plain medical information with no political content. The report states "their websites sometimes push lies that abortion can cause infertility and breast cancer, all the while collecting extensive, personal data from potential abortion seekers at a time of growing legal risk." 
</p>
<p>
    Even if the various actors involved in this are not directly colluding, we see the overall trend as part of the growing fascist movement in the US. Yet, circumstantial evidence suggests many in the public and private sectors are coordinating their opposition to women's health rights. Abortion is a contentious issue among Americans for philosophical and religious reasons, and compelling arguments exist on both sides of the question. It thus makes a useful lever to tear down women's healthcare rights generally. 
</p>
<p>
    Fomenting confusion through misinformation and disinformation, controlling the definitions of terms (e.g., Georga representative Marjorie Taylor Greene insists abortion is not healthcare), creating an atmosphere of guilt by association, and driving wedges between segments of the population are common tactics of fascist movements. When like-minded people use consistent language, exhibit similar behaviors, and express support for each other in pursuit of common goals, they can be said to be colluding even when they have not established any formal organizational structure or plan of action together.
</p>
<p>
    It would take up too much space to list all indications of cultural misogyny. Of course, none of that is directly related to the law in Oklahoma. It is meant to set the general context for the ways in which US authorities handle domestic abuses cases, and perhaps some of the reasons the general public accepts it all silently.
</p>
<p>
    The subset of misogynistic cases that pertains to the Okahoma survivors' law consists of extremely harsh sentencing for women who defended themselves out of desperation from abusive husbands and boyfriends, or who were coerced into committing crimes by abusive husbands and boyfriends and then were sentenced alongside them. The fact the abusive circumstances have not been considered in trial until very recently and only in a few states reflects the deeply-ingrained undercurrent of misogyny in the general culture. 

<h3>How would this play out under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    That was a fairly long background section for a blog post, but we felt it was appropriate to set the stage for our speculation about how the American State system might differ. Systematic, deliberate oppression of women touches on several aspects of the American State system. The differences can't be examined properly by asking <em>only</em> how the State would handle charges filed against victims of domestic abuse, and omitting the rest of the context.
</p>
<p>
    The reason this apparently-simple question touches on so many different aspects of the State system is the fact that some of the most fundamental assumptions and principles of the two systems are so different. The US system, despite its carefully-crafted inclusive-sounding language, was originally meant to preserve the privilege of wealthy, English, white, Protestant, male landowners who belonged to certain important families. The American State, in contrast, is explicitly meant to support the foremost desire of the "average" American - individual liberty, with provisions to make such liberty sustainable and fair for all. 
</p>
<p>
    Exploring the implications of maximizing individual liberty, we quickly find the necessity to limit our own liberty when it conflicts with the rights of others. Who are these "others?" They are <em>human beings</em>. So, what are the natural rights of human beings? To answer that question, we first have to have a working definition of <em>human</em>. 
</p>
<p>
    In the <em>Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</em> (linked in the references), we reason about the definition of <em>human</em>. We arrive at an answer that everyone hates. Some hate our definition because it recognizes the human rights of a viable fetus. Others hate our definition because it recognizes the human rights of the woman carrying that fetus. 
</p>
<p>
    What can we do when the human rights of two people conflict? Whether it is the rights of a pregnant woman vs. those of the viable fetus she carries, the rights of a domestic abuser vs. those of his victim, or any other conflict between the human rights of two or more people, the State is required to act in accordance with Utilitarian Ethics.
</p>
<p>
    In the <em>Backgrounder on Ethics</em> (linked in the references), we explain that the State model is based on an ethical framework in which people try to make choices that maximize the benefit and minimize the harm for the most people over the longest time. Under the State system, Utilitarian Ethics is the tiebreaker for cases in which people have to choose between the rights of two individuals. You can also think of it as Kindergarten Wisdom - one person's rights end where the next person's begin. 
</p>
<p>
    This long-winded preamble comes down to just this: In a case of domestic abuse, in a case of self-defense, or in any other case, the State's action is required by law to be based on Utilitarian Ethics. Courts must take actions that result in the maximum benefit and/or minimum harm to the most people over the longest time. 
</p>
<p>
    Most people hate this because (we speculate) they insist that every problem must have a "happy" solution. We recognize that in many cases no "happy" solution exists. The best we can achieve is the solution that causes the least harm overall.
</p>
<p>
    A second reason people hate the State's approach may be that the least-harmful-overall solution may not align with their personal ideology, values, or beliefs. They would prefer to cause harm in order to maintain alignment with their preferred ideology, values, or beliefs. The purpose of the State is only to enable Americans to enjoy the maximum feasible level of individual liberty on a sustainable basis; nothing more. Depending on circumstances, that may or may not align with any given person's ideology, values, or beliefs. 
</p>
<p>
    Misogyny in all its forms always harms women, by definition. Therefore, any woman affected by misogyny (or any person observing such) can file a legal complaint alleging that someone has caused harm. The State is required to investigate all such complaints. 
</p>
<p>
    Given a misogynistic culture, the people responsible for enforcing the State's Legal Code may abuse their positions in order to oppress selected groups, including women. The Legal Code includes a statute prohibiting the use of the law as a "weapon" to cause harm intentionally. The statute provides protection against people using the legal complaint process to falsely accuse someone of abuse. The Legal Code also provides a robust process for appeals. This is not absolute protection against corruption or abuse, but it is at least a legal basis to minimize the harm done by corruption and abuse of the law. 
</p>
<p>
    Getting down to cases of domestic abuse victims who take action in their own defense or in defense of their children, under the State system their circumstances will be considered in trial. It is not so easy for judges to exclude evidence or testimony, and our system allows for contextual information such as previous behavior to be taken in evidence. Another legal difference that keeps coming up on this blog is the fact the State considers the intent of the law to be more important than the letter of the law. These legal differences would result in significant differences in outcomes for victims of domestic abuse. 
</p>
<p>
    In one of the cases described in the references, a woman filed for a restraining order against her violent husband. The police declined to enforce the order. The husband killed their three children, then went to the police station to commit "suicide by cop." Had that happened under the State system, it is likely the children and the abuser would have died, but the law enforcement personnel who had failed to enforce the restraining order would be prosecuted. They would be considered to be partially responsible for the four deaths. We believe this would be a strong motivator for law enforcement officials to enforce restraining orders. 
</p>
<p>
    But the problem of the underlying culture of misogyny will not be solved by legislation alone. The State's education system includes guiding young people to apply critical thinking, Kindergarten Wisdom, and respect for human rights. Hopefully, these lessons will carry forward into adulthood, where they <em>may</em> influence deep cultural change over time. We cannot guarantee this outcome, but at least our system does <em>something</em> rather than the <em>nothing</em> that the present-day system does.
</p>
<p>
    On a final note, part of the Transition Plan calls for the Legal Review Board to review the cases of every incarcerated person. Currently, the US holds more people in prison than any other country. It seems unlikely all of them are truly a danger to society. The inmates include all the women who have been sentenced harshly for acts that really amount to justifiable self-defense. In the course of the Transition, they will be pardoned and released, or their sentences reduced as appropriate. Their cases would probably be treated as a high priority for review.
