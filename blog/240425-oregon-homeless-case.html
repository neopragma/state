This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Oregon Homelessness Case</h1>

<p>
    25 April 2024
</p>

<p>
    The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) recently heard a case in which suit was brought against the town of Grants Pass, Oregon, claiming the town's heavy-handed action against homeless people violated the 8th Amendment of the US Constitution, prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. The city's response to a growing homelessness problem was to prohibit sleeping outdoors, and to fine people for doing so. They shut off the water supply to public parks and closed the restrooms there. 
</p>
<p>
    City council president Lily Morgan told Oregon Public Broadcasting, "The point is to make it uncomfortable enough for them in our city so they will want to move on down the road."
</p>
<p>
    One of the people Ms Morgan would like to move on down the road is Laura Gutowski, whose kids were born and raised in the neighborhood near the park where she sleeps. She lived in a house not far from the park for 25 years, and only became homeless recently when her husband died. 
</p>
<p>
    Another person forced to live outdoors for financial reasons is Helen Cruz, who works cleaning houses in Grants Pass. She has accumulated several thousand dollars in fines for the horrific crime of having no place to live, which she will never be able to pay. 
</p>
<p>
    The city has no public homeless shelter where people down on their luck could stay while they get their lives back in order. Once a person loses their home, they become nothing more than "garbage." City policy ensures they can never pick themselves up again. 
</p>
<p>
    It seems the city has succeeded in making homelessness "uncomfortable," as if it weren't already. 
</p>
<p>
    The policy of forcing homeless people to "move on down the road" has been called a "banishment race." If most or all towns and cities take the same approach, homeless people will have nowhere to go. 
</p>
<p>
    Justice Sotomayor said, "Where do we put them if every city, every village, every town lacks compassion?"
</p>
<p>
    The same NPR report that quoted Justic Sotomayor provided the answer: Concentration camps. "Florida's governor recently signed a law that seeks to move unhoused people off public property altogether and into government-run encampments." 
</p>
<p>
    And after the concentration camps, then what? Gosh, it's too bad there aren't any historical precedents to give us a clue as to where that approach will lead. As it stands now, we have absolutely no idea.
</p>
<p>
    The conservative Justices keep repeating that homelessness is a complex policy problem. They scratch their chins and ask each other whether sleeping and urinating are "rights" under the Constitution. They pretend they don't already know about approaches that have worked in hundreds of cities around the world, including some in the United States. Oh my, what an intractable problem! 
</p>
<p>
    "Why would you think that these nine people are the best people to judge and weigh those policy judgments?" Chief Justice Roberts asked. Well, jeepers, Justice Roberts, I guess you aren't. 
</p>
<p>
    Why do Americans ignore solutions that have already been demonstrated to be effective? In part, it's because of cultural conditioning that has been systematically applied since the mid-19th century, to the effect that if a person is wealthy it's because God loves them and trusts them to manage the wealth properly, and if they're poor it's because they're sinners and God wants to punish them. 
</p>
<p>
    Conservative Americans take it a step beyond that. If an idea is based to any degree on compassion, they literally can't conceive of it. They can't see it, can't hear it. "Huh? What do you mean, housing first? I recognize the individual words you're saying, but when you string them together in that order it sounds like gibberish."
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of the State is reiterated at the top of each page in this set of documents. Please note there is no reference to any political "-ism." Any situation that hinders the achievement of the purpose of the State is considered a "problem." Any problem has a solution. We don't care whether an effective solution comes from the political left or right or any other direction. 
</p>
<p>
    So, the way this would be handled under the State system is that the already-known, already-documented, already-proven solutions to homelessness would be applied across the board. 
</p>
<p>
    We would never ask our neighbors, who were solid citizens for 25+ years, to "move on down the road." That is not the kind of country we want to live in.
