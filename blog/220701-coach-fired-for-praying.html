This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Coach Fired for Praying</h1>

<p>
    1 July 2022
</p>

<p>
    Joseph Kennedy, the football coach at Bremerton High School in Washington state, was fired for praying on the field after games. The rationale for firing him was that the public school is funded by tax revenue, and the Constitution of the United States prohibits the government from establishing an official religion. 
</p>
<p>
    Kennedy appealed to the US Supreme Court. In the complaint filed with the Court, his prayers were described as "a quiet personal prayer." Videos of one of the prayers shows the team gathered around him, participating in the prayer, and afterwards jumping up and pumping their fists into the air, shouting, "Jesus! Jesus!" 
</p>
<p>
    The Court ruled in favor of Kennedy, who was reinstated. A Washington Post editorial said that he "toned down his prayers, but refused to stop using his privileged access to the 50-yard line to engage in public religious displays in the middle of an official school event while wearing team attire."
</p>
<p>
    Although the coach was reinstated, and despite the decision of the Court, the general public is not in agreement about whether this custom violates the Constitutional separation of church and state.
</p>

<h3>
    How would this situation play out under the State system?
</h3>

<p>
    The separation of religion from the State is much stricter than the separation clause of the US Constitution. However, the purpose of the State is to enable the maximum practical degree of individual liberty that can be sustained. Our position is that an individual is free to express their religious faith anywhere and at any time, limited only by other laws - they cannot violate anyone's human rights or legal rights and they cannot undermine the Three Pillars of Independence. The fact an individual is employed by an institution that is funded by tax revenue does not cancel their individual right of free expression. 
</p>
<p>
    When a Christian offers a Christian prayer after a football game, there is no offense to any other religion or to atheism. It is simply an individual expressing their feelings. Should Christian members of the team choose to join the coach in such prayer, there is no offense to any other religion or to atheism. 
</p>
<p>
    One of the main authors of this political model is an atheist who participated in public school activities when a child and teen, and who was present on countless occasions when Christian prayers were offered during school functions, including assemblies, sports contests, and musical performances. At no time was there any pressure to join in, and at no time were there any negative repercussions for failing to join in. 
</p>
<p>
    Even if the prayer was not a "quiet personal prayer," but rather a loud group prayer that included shouting "Jesus!" and pumping fists in the air, it is an expression of religious faith. In the State system, that is not a legal offense even if it is carried out during a public school function. It <em>would</em> be an offense for the school to schedule and direct such a prayer, and require students to participate, or punish students for failing to participate. As long as the prayer is voluntary and a matter of the coach's personal expression, there is no violation of State law.
</p>

<h3>
    Discussion points
</h3>

<p>
    Some have argued that any religious expression on the grounds of or during an official function of any institution that is funded by tax revenue violates the separation of religion and the government. We consider this to be an extreme position. Individual Americans do not forfeit their religious rights when they accept a job with such an institution. The <em>institution</em> cannot require any particular religious services or displays, but <em>individuals</em> who work there are free to express their religious beliefs, provided they violate no laws - for example, followers of a religion that calls for human sacrifice at the winter solstice would not be free to practice that rite.
</p>
<p>
    Some have argued that Christian prayers denigrate members of other faiths as well as non-believers. It makes minority believers feel threatened or belittled. Our position is that members of all faiths are equally free to express themselves. There are no barriers, for instance, to Hindus displaying religious decorations for Diwali. The fact most such expressions are Christian simply reflects the fact that the majority of Americans are Christians.
</p>
<p>
    Religious freedom means you cannot be prevented from attending religious services, wearing religious attire, or otherwise demonstrating your faith. It also means the State cannot use religious grounds as the basis for any law or administrative procedure. It does <em>not</em> mean that individuals are prohibited from expressing their beliefs in any venue where you might see or hear them, just because you don't share those beliefs. 
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the State is to provide an environment in which all Americans can live according to their own values, individually. All Americans are not Christians, and all Americans are not anti-Christian. Both must be able to live comfortably in the same country. That requires all of us to be respectful of each other and "put on our Big Boy pants."
