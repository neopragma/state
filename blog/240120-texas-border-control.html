This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Texas Border Control</h1>

<p>
    20 January 2024
</p>

<p>
On top of regressive social policies, intrusive political action affecting other US states (such as sending busloads of asylum-seekers to so-called "Democrat cities" with no advance warning or planning), closures of school libraries and public libraries, a public school curriculum based on lies and propaganda, a banned book list exceeding 15,000 titles (including the works of William Shakespeare), wide-ranging censorship dictating what topics people are allowed to discuss privately among themselves, religion-based persecution, violent police policies, inaction to curtail mass shootings, and more, the state of Texas has illegally wrested border patrol authority from the federal government. 
</p>
Gov. Greg Abbott established a paramilitary force to patrol the Texas-Mexico border, circumventing federal authority per the Constitution. This force has physically prevented duly authorized US Border Patrol agents from accessing the border area. The Governor also pushed through legislation authorizing Texas military units to employ unmanned drones in paramilitary operations to prevent people crossing into Texas from Mexico. It's easy to see the direction these policies are moving.
</p>
<p>
In the <a href="../bg-international.html">Backgrounder on International Relations</a>, we have already mentioned several reasons to exclude Texas - as well as several other of the current states - from the new American State. This recent action with respect to border control provides additional cause. If Texans want to control their own borders, then they need to be an independent country. Border control is not a state prerogative according to the US Constitution. 
</p>
<p>
At times they are acting as if they are already independent - when it's convenient for them - and at times acting like a US state - when it's convenient for them. This is not "convenient" for America. In our view, it is another demonstration of the fact the multi-state structure of the US has outlived its usefulness. We need a single government for America. Then problems like this simply would not occur.
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
	The specific case of Texas would not come up, as Texas is not part of the American State. However, should any local group attempt to usurp the rightful authority of the State - with respect to border control or any other matter - it would be treated as an act of insurrection. 
</p>
<p>
	The State would follow a course of gradual escalation that would culminate in the end of the insurrection. Those who agreed to surrender early in the process would be investigated to determine each individual's level of participation, and penalties would be applied accordingly. Low-level operatives might receive sentences of community service, if even that. Decision-makers and leaders would probably face incarceration for some period, with the length of the sentence mitigated by the fact they chose to surrender early.
</p>
<p>
	Those who chose to fight the State would be considered to have exercised their <em>free choice of reckless action</em> and would be subject to being killed as the State military recaptured territory and reestablished authority over the area. 
</p>
<p>
	Finally, survivors would be arrested and prosecuted for insurrection. They would be treated similarly to those who had surrendered early, but without any mitigation of sentences.
