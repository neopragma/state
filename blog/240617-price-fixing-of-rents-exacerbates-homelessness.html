This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Price Fixing of Rents Exacerbates Homelessness</h1>

<p>
    17 June 2024
</p>

<p>
    The Attorney General of the state of Arizona has filed suit against a private company named RealPage for collusion and price-fixing of rents for some 200 properties in the cities of Phoenix and Tucson. RealPage provides software products, data analytics services, and advice on setting prices for residental rental units for landlords across the United States. The suit alleges their methods amount to illegal collusion and price-fixing.
</p>
<p>
    The rental business has traditionally operated on the basis of maximizing occupancy. RealPage advises landlords to focus instead on maximizing rents. This approach results in marginal improvements in profits for landlords with the side-effect of leaving many units unoccupied. At a time when most young adults are unable to afford housing and when the general problem of homelessness is growing, the net effect is to create widespread economic hardship on the American people. 
</p>
<p>
    Until now, RealPage has sidestepped existing laws against collusion and price-fixing by claiming that they are an external, independent service; they own no rental properties directly, and their clients do not directly collude with each other. The Arizona Attorney General has determined that this activity amounts to genuine collusion even though RealPage is not a landlord and the actual landlords are not working directly with each other to fix prices. 
</p>
<p>
    The potential penalties under the US system may include fines and a cease and desist order. These penalties will take effect at the state level in whichever states follow up on the matter. Neither RealPage as a company nor the individual decision-makers within the company will face particularly serious consequences.
</p>

<h3>How would this play out under the State system?</h3>
<p>
    The complaint filed by the Arizona Attorney General is consistent with the intent of American State law. The main difference in this case concerns the scope of the offense and the response of the people to the offense. The penalties for the offenders may also differ, due to the way offenses are categorized under the American State system.
</p>
<p>
    The US legal system emphasizes the letter of the law over the intent of the law, while the American State emphasizes the intent of the law over the letter. RealPage has been able to get away with managing collusion on behalf of landlords by dancing carefully around the letter of the law. 
</p>
<p>
    Under the American State system, this sort of dance is not possible. When an actor causes harm to others, they commit an offense. When companies use their relatively great power to harm individuals, who have relatively little power, the offense is considered to be more egregious than when the perpetrator and victim have more-or-less equivalent power. In addition, there is a statute prohibiting the use of the letter of the law as a "weapon" to cause harm intentionally. Thus, the penalties in this case could be greater than those possible under the US system.
</p>
<p>
    Under the present-day US system, laws prohibiting fraud and collusion are defined at the state level. The Arizona suit can only address collusion within the state of Arizona. The collusion affects landlords and rental properties in that state's two main cities, Phoenix and Tucson.
</p>
<p>     
    However, RealPage operates nationwide. The Arizona suit may or may not set a precedent for other states' Attorneys General to act. Addressing the overall problem across the country could take considerable time and outcomes may vary from state to state.
</p>
<p>
    The American State is a single entity with a single body of law. The first action against RealPage would address the effects of collusion nationwide, and corrective action could be nearly immediate. 
</p>
<p>
    We consider this a significant improvement over having 50 different sets of laws and 50 different jurisdictions. Under the US system, an offender such as RealPage can slip around state-level laws by moving portions of their operations around the country. Americans are subject to continued suffering for many years before the problem can be solved.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the potential penalties for collusion in fixing rental prices in a way that leaves many units vacant while working Americans are unable to afford housing, some differences in sentencing are possible due to differences between US and American State law. 
</p>
<p>
    First, the American State explicitly recognizes the differences between <em>deficiency needs</em> and <em>growth needs</em> in humans. Deficiency needs must be met in order to satisfy Constitutional and statutory requirements to support fundamental human rights. In addition, the State connects the dots between the desperation of people whose deficiency needs are unmet and their vulnerability to external influences - a threat to the Defense Pillar. 
</p>
<p>
    As a result, price-fixing of rents could be prosecuted as a Category 1 offense. Combining these considerations with the fact incorporation does not provide a legal shield for company decision-makers, those responsible for the collusion would face direct, personal consequences.
</p>
<p>
    RealPage may well provide valuable services to its customers other than illegal activities like price-fixing. Under the American State system, the decision-makers would pay the penalties for collusion while the company itself could continue to operate and provide services that are legal. Under the US system, if multiple states take action against RealPage the company could go out of business. It's possible this could harm the economy.
</p>
<p>
    The American State is based in part on Utilitarian Ethics, which call for us to choose actions that result in the maximum benefit and/or minimum harm to the most people for the longest time. Therefore, punishing the decision-makers individually rather than destroying the company may be considered the least harmful response to the offense.
