This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Foreign Influence In America</h1>

<p>
    22 May 2024
</p>

<p>
    From about mid-2022 until the time this was written in mid-2024, members of the Republican Party and former members of former President Trump's staff have suggested that some individuals have received money from the Russian government in exchange for supporting the Russian agenda in Ukraine and in other matters. Some have reported learning of such payments as early as 2016. 
</p>
<p>
    There is no hard proof of this as of mid-2024, but there is proof of similar corruption in Europe. Some European Union officials have received money from the Russian Government in exchange for their support. Fears have been growing in the United States that the Russians are pursuing a similar program in this country. It would be entirely consistent with Russian foreign policy tactics throughout the history of that country.
</p>
<p>
    Even lacking direct financial compensation, there appears to be strong support for Russia and for Vladimir Putin personally among many Republican leaders, Republican voters, and various right-wing extremist groups in the United States.
</p>
<p> 
    Prominent Republican Mitch McConnell has dismissed the idea, saying that any Republicans who support Russia are "a few lonely voices." It may be true that sincere American conservatives would be shocked to learn this kind of support was real. 
</p>
<p>
    Can we afford to make assumptions about it? Should there be an investigation?
</p>

<h3>How would this play out under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    To degrade the structure of the system that enables Americans to enjoy maximum individual liberty on a sustainable basis is a Category 1 offense under State law. Evidence that any citizen or resident of America was promoting the agenda of a foreign government or non-governmental organization would be investigated carefully, regardless of the individual's position in government or the private sector. 
</p>
<p>
    If the accused held a position in Government, their work would be suspended pending resolution of the case. During that time, they would have no access to sensitive information and their movements would be tracked. 
</p>
<p>
    State law enforcement would follow up on the evidence to determine whether it was sufficient to bring charges. If so, then the case would be pursued in the court system. If anyone were convicted, they would face the most serious legal consequences allowed under State law. 
</p>
<p>
    A possible difference between the State system and the present-day US system is that the question of financial compensation is not central to the State's case. The fact the individual acted in a way that created an existential threat to the system that enables our freedom would be the central point. If they also received payment for doing so, that factor would be considered during sentencing. 
</p>
<p>
    State law doesn't draw a distinction between treason and sedition in the way US law does. Any action that undermines the Three Pillars of Independence is an offense on the level of treason. Acting on behalf of a foreign power to the detriment of America certainly qualifies as treason. 
</p>
<p>
    The State has no death penalty. Depending on the facts of the case and any mitigating circumstances, the sentence for this sort of offense may range from five years to thirty years incarceration. Forfeiture of some or all financial and material assets may also result.
