This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Social Safety Net</h1>

<p>
    8 August 2022
</p>

<p>
    In a recent spirited discussion of some of the core ideas of the proposed State system, some different perspectives on the idea of a social safety net emerged. 
</p>
<p>
    According to the documentation of the State model, there is a social safety net that provides basic sustenance, healthcare, living accommodations, and even a guaranteed basic income to the poorest members of society. 
</p>
<p>
    The rationale is two-fold: First, the model is based in part on the concept of <em>human rights</em>, and the first human right in the list is, simply, the right to life. Second, the model considers the <em>sustainability</em> of the system. History shows what happens when a large segment of a population is destitute: They rise up and overthrow the existing government. 
</p>
<p>
    This is the reason the State system includes the notion of <em>bread and circuses</em>. If the people have enough to eat and a dry place to sleep, and they have some form of entertainment, they won't rise up and overthrow the government. People only do that when they're quite uncomfortable and have no prospects for self-improvement.
</p>

<h3>If you don't work, you don't eat</h3>

<p>
    One perspective that emerged from the discussion is the idea that people must earn the right to have food by working. There are "plenty" of low-level jobs they could perform. Those who choose not to perform one of these jobs don't deserve food. The system should provide <em>opportunity</em> for people, but not <em>outcomes</em>. 
</p>
<p>
    That last point is consistent with the State model, but not when taken to the extreme that we allow people to die of starvation just because they can't find a job. One person made the argument that people should take one of the numerous low-paying, low-skill jobs that need to be done. 
</p>
<p>
    The counterargument was that just because a job "needs" to be done - a field of weeds that "needs" to be cut, a pile of garbage that "needs" to be taken to the dump, a broken street that "needs" to be patched - it doesn't mean anyone actually creates that job and hires someone to perform it, for pay. 
</p>
<p>
    There may be, say, 1 million low-level jobs available, and 15 million destitute people searching for work. The idea of letting 14 million of them die of starvation through no fault of their own doesn't correspond well with our notion of human rights; nor would it support the sustainability of the system, as people treated in this manner would not wait long before rising up to overturn the government by force. It also contradicts the idea of <em>opportunity</em>, because real opportunity is actionable; having a right on paper, but no practical means to exercise it, isn't much use. If you're starving, you're hardly in a position to act on the opportunity to look for employment.
</p>
<p>
    This argument did not get far, as the individual criticizing the proposed system dismissed the idea there might be fewer jobs available than people who need work. They suggested we could pass a law that made paid work an entitlement for everyone, and another law guaranteeing a livable minimum wage. After all, there's already a lot of work that needs to be done - cleaning things up, repairing things, digging holes, etc. All you have to do is look around, and you'll see the need for these things. "Someone" simply has to gather up the unemployed and point them to the necessary tasks. 
</p>
<p>
    When asked how this would be paid for, they had no answer. It is good to begin with a clear philosophical position. This helps us focus our efforts and resources on the "right things" and to devise morally-acceptable methods to achieve our goals. At some point, philosophy collides with feasibility. Yes, it would be wonderful if everyone could have a job and every job could pay a living wage. Recognizing the reality that perfection is unachievable, what is a feasible approach that moves us in that admirable direction?
</p>

<h3>Unwillingness vs. inability to work</h3>

<p>
    Our discussion did not touch on religious beliefs, but the preceding reminds us of the passage in the Bible, <em>2 Thessalonians 3:10</em>, which reads, "For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: 'The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.'" It also reminds us of the Jamestown colony in North America, founded in 1607. In those days, English gentlemen did not perform manual labor. Of the 105 men at the colony, 35 were gentlemen, 40 were soldiers, and the others were various artisans, laborers, and slaves. The 35 gentlemen would not perform manual labor, so they spent their time searching for gold in the area around the settlement. With starvation setting in, Captain John Smith issued a decree in 1608 that anyone who did not work would not eat. The gentlemen worked. They grumbled, but they worked. 
</p>
<p>
    The person recommending this approach was not speaking from a religious point of view, but the Bible verse is helpful in understanding the context. The religious blog, <em>Proverbs 4:7</em>, explains it this way: "This Bible verse doesn’t pertain to you if you cannot work due to physical challenges, bodily diseases, old age, and the greed of employers, but it does imply (sic) to those who have a job and won’t do it being a busybody, (2nd Thessalonians 3:11). And in (2nd Thessalonians 3:12), scripture is telling those busybodies to get back to work, do their job, and earn their pay. Unwilling and unable are two different things."
</p>
<p>
    In the case of colonial Jamestown, everyone "had a job." Building and sustaining the colony was the common job of all the colonists. Captain Smith's admonition was a reaction to the English custom that members of the upper classes - gentlemen - were not expected to perform manual labor. But the colony was a different context than Merry Old England. If anyone didn't contribute, everyone would die. 
</p>
<p>
    What about people who live on the minimum wage and lose their jobs? The argument then was that they should have been saving some of their pay all along, in case they lost their job and needed to live on their savings for a while. That's good advice for anyone in the middle class or above, but they call it "minimum" wage for a reason. Even if the minimum wage is set at a level that enables people to pay rent, buy food, and travel to and from work, it will not be sufficient for them to save. By definition, it is just enough to "get by." If people at this socioeconomic level lose their jobs, they need time to find another, and they need food while they search. It's a commonplace in the United States that "conservatives" tell the poor to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps when they know full well the poor have no bootstraps. 
</p>
<p>
    The "bootstraps" argument is not a valid criticism of the State model; it is one of the problems the State model seeks to solve. To argue in favor of it is to argue in favor of a problem. Why would anyone want to argue in favor of a problem?
</p>

<h3>The risk of creating societal parasites</h3>

<p>
    One participant in the discussion lived in a country that had a generous social safety net and offered a number of benefits free of charge well beyond what is available in the United States. That country's democratic government was overthrown by a mass of poor people who had been influenced by a populist demagogue, and is now a dictatorship. Previously, any citizen of that country was entitled to free education through any level, even the PhD level, free healthcare, and generous subsidies for food and gasoline. 
</p>
<p>
    Through corruption, and not as a direct result of the social services system, politicians bought the votes of poor people by promising them free houses, electricity, and water. Eventually, the entire system became overburdened with people who expected and demanded that the government give them all their needs in life, and most of whom were unwilling to work at all. This was the population that became enamored of a populist demagogue and destroyed the very democratic system that had enabled the government to give them everything free of charge. Now they have nothing.
</p>
<p>
    This person could see the potential for the same problem to arise in the State system. They worried that the State's social safety net was similar to the generous system that had existed in their former country. This is a valid concern, and one that we have taken into consideration in developing the model. Another participant in the discussion pointed out that it would be possible, and maybe very easy, to abuse the system we propose. We pointed out that would require illegal acts - subverting the voting system, buying people off, etc. 
</p>
<p>
    We all agreed there is no perfect system, but some were concerned that the State would be especially susceptible to this kind of corruption. We take this seriously, and will continue to reason through various methods of abuse and to develop safeguards against them. We do not expect to arrive at a flawless solution, but we do believe a practical and workable solution exists. We also expect that some members of the society will "game" the system. That will happen with any system in which humans are involved. It happens today, in the best of countries. The problem can be managed well enough to keep the system operational to the benefit of the majority.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps an imperfect system that solves (or at least, reduces) <em>some</em> of the most important problems of the current system would be an improvement. We agreed that certain aspects of the present-day US system are corrupt, including the practice of "lobbying," the Electoral College system, the lack of proportional representation, and the winner-takes-all voting system (as opposed to a ranked-choice system). Not everyone agreed with our weighted voting system, based on Citizens' level of engagement with the system and on their level of education. We think we have addressed concerns raised in previous discussions in that area, but it is worth putting more effort into that part of the model.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, it is not necessary to find the <em>perfect</em> system - the present-day system is so far from perfect that many alternatives are potentially better, even if less than perfect.
</p>

<h3>Public works programs</h3>

<p>
    One suggestion is to create jobs through public works programs, like the New Deal in the United States in the 1930s. We are considering public works programs, as some of the infrastructure updates and other work to build the Three Pillars of Independence will require substantial investment and a great deal of physical labor. This will certainly not hurt people who need jobs. 
</p>
<p>
    But a public works program is not a long-term solution. Once the public works have been completed, the jobs disappear. The long-term solution is an economic system that tends to maintain full employment - a situation in which a high percentage of people have jobs at any given time, and that is characterized by stability as opposed to deficit-demand cycles of high unemployment. That is a problem for any governmental system to solve, and the State has no magic bullets for it. 
</p>


<h3>What is our intent?</h3>

<p>
    What we are trying to achieve in our imperfect way is a system that protects people from becoming destitute or permanently locked into a cycle of poverty when they are between jobs, and to uphold the most basic of all human rights - the right to <em>live</em> as a human being as opposed to <em>exist</em> as an animal. In addition, with respect to those who simply are not interested in working or contributing to the society, we want to ensure they can live at a comfortable, if very basic level so they will not become dissatisfied and resentful of the rest of society - to put it bluntly, so they will not see a need to rebel.
</p>
<p>
    The intent is <em>not</em> to give everyone everything for free. In fact, one of the fundamental human needs we have identified is the need to feel as if we have earned our own way in life; that we have achieved something through our own efforts. To "give" everything to someone is to rob them of that human need. At the same time, we do not want anyone to suffer or die simply because they haven't found a job. They cannot control whether jobs exist.
