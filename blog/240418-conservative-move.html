This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Conservative Move</h1>

<p>
    18 April 2024
</p>

<p>
    One of the first things we plan to accomplish as we transition from the United States to the American State is to separate the two groups of Americans who are unable to live together in harmony. The idea is we can get along better as neighbors than we do as roommates. 
</p>
<p>
    We propose to cede most of the land from South Carolina to Texas to Fascist supporters and help them establish their own independent nation-state, which we call the Confederacy. Ultimately they may decide on a different name for themselves. We have no opinion about that. 
</p>
<p>
    We had expected this aspect of the proposed American State to be highly controversial. Many people love their homes and have chosen to live where they live for a variety of reasons other than "politics." They may have extended family in the area. They may be accustomed to the local cuisine and weather. They may have businesses located there, or careers working with local companies. They may appreciate the quality of the local school systems, even if they disagree with the general political climate.
</p>
<p>
    But there is reason to think the proposal will not be as controversial as we initially believed. There is already substantial demand for real estate services to relocate "conservatives" from so-called blue states to red states. One company that specializes in this type of service is <em>Conservative Move</em> (Internet link in references, below). 
</p>
<p>    
    Based in Texas, Conservative Move was founded in 2017. The company offers comprehensive services to people who want to relocate their families for political reasons. Of course, they will be happy to help anyone move for any reason; but they market themselves heavily to customers who don't like to be surrounded by people who have political or religious views different from their own. Or different skin color, we suspect.
</p>
<p>    
    They say, "When your community no longer reflects morals and values, it might be time to move." They <em>mean</em>, "When your community no longer reflects <em>your</em> morals and values." They don't get to define "morals and values" generally, no matter how fervently they might think otherwise. But that's okay, as long as the Confederates are separating themselves from the Americans peacefully and on their own initiative.
</p>
<p>
    According to founder and president Paul Chabot (see the New York Times article cited below), Texas, Florida, and South Carolina are the most popular destinations for Conservative Move clients. Per the New York Times article, in 2023 "about 15,500 New Yorkers, 15,000 Californians and 36,000 North Carolinians moved to" South Carolina.
</p>
<p>
    From our perspective, Texas, Florida, and South Carolina are the three most extreme pro-Fascist states in the US, and are the three states we would probably not accept back into America after establishing the Confederacy even if they petitioned for re-entry. We could hardly wish for a happier situation.
</p>
<p>
     This trend is very encouraging. Please spread the word to your conservative relatives, co-workers, and acquaintences. The link to Conservative Move is in the references.
