This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Library Closure</h1>

<p>
    14 April 2024
</p>

<p>
    Fox News has been criticized and ridiculed for recent reports of public libraries turning into havens for drug abuse and venues for public sex, drunkenness, and violence. Given the track record of Fox News as a mouthpiece for the most extreme neo-Fascist/Republican propaganda, we thought it prudent to check into the credibility of these claims.  
</p>
<p>
    On the surface, Fox News reporting about public libraries is difficult to believe. Has the neo-Fascist movement reached the stage that they can brazenly say anything at all, however outrageously false, without accountability? Perhaps not. The most damaging lies are often those that contain a grain of truth; and there is a grain of truth here. 
</p>
<p>
    We found a single case of a public library that had gone out of control, and had indeed become a place where unruly behavior occurred on a routine basis, resulting in over 1,800 calls to the police over a period of a few years. But we did not find a pattern of public libraries devolving into unsafe places, as the Fox News reporting might lead consumers of the news to believe. 
</p>
<p>
    One branch of the Contra Costa County Library in Antioch, California, had experienced an ongoing series of incidents that included sex in the bathroom, drunks hanging out in the library and harassing patrons, drug sales in the parking lot, a hit-and-run in the parking lot, a burning mattress left in the parking lot, and assorted minor incidents besides those more-serious ones. Eventually the problems got so bad the branch closed its doors.
</p>
<p>
    The problem with the way Fox News has reported the matter is that they crafted the story to make it seem as if the entire public library system nationwide had spiraled into decay. We suspect they intentionally crafted the story in this way in hopes one of the neo-Fascist supporters would take it upon himself to do something about it, in the way such people characteristically do - by shooting up a public library chosen at random. 
</p>
<p>
    We suspect their manner of reporting constitutes stochastic terrorism. Stochastic terrorism is legal under US law, but would be illegal under State law.
</p>
<p>
    Why would Fox News wish to inspire an act of violence at a public library? The neo-Fascists have been putting pressure on public libraries for some time now, in a way that seems consistent with their desire to restrict Americans' access to information so the people will be easier to control. Fox News' close association with the neo-Fascist movement suggests they are willing to use their voice to further that agenda. 
</p>
<p>
    In September, 2023, Fox News published a piece that stated flatly there are no banned books in the United States, and the noise about banned book lists is a maneuver by "the Left" to create panic. Yet, so-called "red" states have been publishing banned book lists for several years now, and have enacted laws to bring felony charges against public school teachers who provide students with access to those books, and in some cases against teachers who make students "aware" of the existence of those books. The same Fox News report states that Democrats defend pornography for children through public school libraries - a plain lie, as well as slander. That report qualifies as stochastic terrorism - part of an organized campaign to erode public trust in libraries and schools. 
</p>
<p>
    A curious side note: Fox News published another report, also in September of 2023, stating that banned book lists do exist and that there were nearly 1,500 reports of books banned in various states around the US in the first half of 2022, verified by subsequent investigations. They noted there is a long history of censorship in the US, but the scope of it has reached unprecedented levels in recent years. Fox News has reported on the book banning trend in the US previously, as well (see references below). They are well aware of the problem. They knew the report denying the existence of banned book lists was a lie.
</p>
<p>
    The majority of Americans seem to be taking these reports as a joke. It's easy to make fun of Fox News and to say the reports are obviously stupid. After all, they <em>are</em> obviously stupid. But that isn't the point. It is part of a larger program by the neo-Fascist/Republican movement to take power and end democracy. That program is <em>not</em> stupid. It is a highly professional propaganda program managed and operated by espionage specialists and experts in psychological warfare. They know exactly how to push people's buttons. Some analysts reckon around 75 million Americans have bought into the Fascist narrative.
</p>
<p>
    The program, which the Republicans call their Strategic Communications program, or StratCom, has been operational for several decades. Ordinary Americans, or "the Left," or whatever you choose to call those who are not part of the neo-Fascist movement have no comparable apparatus or skill-set to counter the program.
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    If a news agency were suspected of intentionally spreading lies, the State would first determine the accuracy of the information. If the information was found to be accurate, then the State would investigate those who had filed the complaint against the news agency to determine whether they had attempted to use the law as a weapon. Doing so is an offense under the State system.
</p>
<p>
    If the information published by the news agency was found to be inaccurate, then the State would undertake a preliminary investigation to determine whether the news agency knew the information was inaccurate at the time they published it. Based on the results of the investigation, the State would determine whether further action was warranted.
</p>
<p>
    If the finding from the preliminary investigation was that the agency knew the information was inaccurate and published it anyway, then a deeper investigation would be undertaken. The intent of the inaccurate reporting would become an important factor for subsequent action. 
</p>
<p>
    Incompetence is not an offense, but intentionally misleading the public may be an offense if the intent is to undermine the stability of the State. In that case, it would be a Category 1 offense - stochastic terrorism with the goal of undermining the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>
<p>
    Under the State system, incorporation does not provide a legal shield for the individuals in a company. The heads of the news agency as well as those who participated in the acts of stochastic terrorism would be personally accountable under the law. The penalties would depend on the kind of damage they caused and on the extent of such damage (both qualitative and quantitative considerations). Penalties would vary based on each individual's contribution to the crime.
