This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>I Will Not Eat Bugs: States Ban Lab-Grown Meat</h1>

<p>
    18 May 2024
</p>

<p>
    We began to think about an alternative political model for America because of a trend in the United States over a period of decades, affecting all levels of government, the private sector, and the general population, away from reason and common sense and toward superstition and stupidity. In the 2020s, the trend seems to be accelerating out of control. The country may well tear itself apart from within long before the idea of the American State has a chance even to be introduced and discussed broadly, let alone implemented.  
</p>
<p>
    As this is written, several US states have passed or are considering legislation to ban the use of meat cultivated from stem cells, popularly called "lab-grown meat."  
</p>
<h3>What is cell-cultivated meat and why are some people against it?</h3>
<p>
    Cell-cultivated meat is produced by extracting stem cells from food animals and nurturing the cells in a controlled environment so that they grow into a mass of edible meat. This is entirely different from vegetable-based synthetic meat products. It isn't synthetic meat, it's real meat. It never walked around and said, "moo" or went "cluck-cluck." It started out as meat. Just meat.
</p>
<p>
    Lab-grown meat is not yet on the market. It's in an advanced experimental stage and may be market-ready in the near future. 
</p>
<p>
    Fear of the new product seems to come from three sources. First, there is a chance the availability of another form of meat will affect the profits of large agricultural businesses that specialize in raising animals and selling their meat. Second, there is a religious argument that God makes animals while Man makes lab-grown meat, and the latter is therefore spiritually unwholesome. Third - and this seems to be the primary concern at the grassroots level - there is a belief in the myth that "they" want "us" to own nothing, live in pods, and eat bugs. 
</p>
<p>
    It's hard to get a straight answer about why people want to prohibit lab-grown meat. We suspect this is because for "Big Ag" to admit they're trying to manipulate the market to the financial detriment of consumers would make them "look bad," so they focus on protecting important economic interests instead. The other two reasons are silly. People want a majority to vote in favor of the laws prohibiting lab-grown meat. They won't convince the majority based on silly reasons, so they try to instill fear of something else, like economic damage or health issues. 
</p>
<p>
    The Florida bill "also preempts local regulations for electric vehicles" and includes provisions to criminalize the harvesting of certain wild plants for food, as well as increasing the criminal penalties for trespassing on the property of agricultural companies. The initial version of the bill included a prohibition on <em>research</em> into stem-cultivated meat. This was removed as a nod to the space industry, which is considering stem-cultivated meat for long-term space voyages. These additional details suggest there are motivations beyond straightforward business concerns.
</p>
<p>
    Would stem-cultivated meat threaten the profits of traditional agricultural companies? Maybe, but not if a pound of stem-cultivated beef cost $8,000. That's for the private sector to determine, not law. The US states banning stem-cultivated meat in the 2020s are overstepping their role as private-sector entities in a democratic country. Even as "conservatives" decry invasive government, they practice the same.
</p>

<h3>What does this have to do with the American State?</h3>
<p>
    We are not in the meat business, the religion business, or the conspiracy business. We aren't for or against lab-grown meat. What interests us is the level of extremism and stupidity behind the legislative trend. We see it as part of the accelerating downward spiral of American society, business, and government. 
</p>
<p>
    We have a plan to transition the country gracefully from one system to another, but if the country comes apart at the seams before that can happen, there will be chaos. Whatever new system emerges from that, we can't predict. In any case it probably won't be as considerate of Americans' needs as the State system. Our new dictator will be whichever bully is able to get enough guns into the right places at the right moments to seize power. 
</p>

<h3>How would this play out under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    From its inception, the State has a responsibility to establish regulatory agencies for any activity that affects the health of Americans, and to monitor those agencies to ensure they are doing what they're supposed to do. The agencies, in turn, are responsible for setting standards and checking compliance, as well as for testing new products to determine their safety and effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>
    The Transition Plan calls for the State to continue the operation of existing regulatory agencies. For example, the American Medical Association would continue to be responsible for standards in medical practice; the National Rifle Association would be responsible for standards in firearms safety; and the Food and Drug Administration would be responsible for standards pertaining to food products - including stem-cultivated meat.
</p>
<p>
    If cell-cultivated meat became a new type of product while the State system was in place, it would be subject to this sort of regulatory oversight. As long as the product met the nutritional and safety standards its labeling claimed, it would be legal in America. At that point, the operation of free market forces would determine the economic viability of the new product. 
</p>
<p>
    Under the State system, Americans would be free to believe in whatever conspiracy theories and other nonsense they chose, but the system includes mechanisms to mitigate the power of such voices in shaping the law. Those who felt lab-grown meat was not for them would never be required to consume it. They would not, however, be free to interfere with anyone else's right to choose whichever food products they might wish to purchase. Kindergarten Wisdom.
