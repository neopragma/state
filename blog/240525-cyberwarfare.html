<h1>Cyberwarfare: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea</h1>

<p>
    25 May 2024
</p>

<p>
    The United States and other developed countries around the world face a growing threat of cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare from aggressive nations such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. 
</p>
<p>
    The way infrastructure is organized in the US and the details of US and state-level law concerning infrastructure security impose limits on the steps the US can take to protect against cyberattacks and the countermeasures legally available to deter or punish perpetrators. The government can make suggestions, but cannot enforce any security-related measures. The OPB report cited in the references notes:
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Some barriers are foundational. The water sector is highly fragmented. There are roughly 50,000 community water providers, most of which serve small towns. Modest staffing and anemic budgets in many places make it hard enough to maintain the basics â€” providing clean water and keeping up with the latest regulations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
    "Certainly, cybersecurity is part of that, but that's never been their primary expertise. So, now you're asking a water utility to develop this whole new sort of department" to handle cyberthreats, said Amy Hardberger, a water expert at Texas Tech University.
</p>
<p>
    Decentralization is a strength, but fragmentation is a weakness. When it comes to something as fundamental to life as clean drinking water, individual water utilities should not have the option to leave themselves open to cyberattacks; nor should they be left without support. 
</p>
<p>
    The complaint that utilities lack expertise in cybersecurity is valid. Fifty thousand separate small companies can't be expected to counter a concerted, professional, continuous cyberwarfare program backed by a hostile nation-state. The lack of central authority over critical infrastructure is the US' Achilles' heel in this arena.
</p>
<p>
    Even so, ordinary people can take common-sensical measures. In one ransomware attack, hackers entered a utility's system by using the PC-based software their employees use to work remotely. By following simple practices such as defining hard-to-crack passwords, not writing passwords down or sharing them with coworkers, and exiting software and/or locking the desktop or laptop system when away from one's desk, people could prevent most such attacks. A utility could also simply disallow remote work.
</p>
<p>
    At the institutional level, utilities can avoid connecting their systems to the public Internet. That is the way nearly all hackers get into systems. If there is any need for a networked computer system to run a utility, that system can be installed on a closed, private network. 
</p>
<p>
    The problem for the United States is that there is no central authority with the legal clout to make anything happen. Everything is a suggestion or a standard that utilities are requested to follow.
</p>
<h3>Why Americans generally misunderstand the threat landscape</h3>
<p>
    Even without a central authority, why don't the people operating infrastructure facilities take the simple steps mentioned above? We think it is because they aren't aware of the scope of the problem.
</p>
<p>
    Americans make many assumptions about other cultures that lead to unpleasant surprises. Foremost among these is the assumption that everyone else thinks or feels basically the same way as we do about fundamental values, human rights, and freedom. 
</p>
<p>
    It is an error to assume everyone wants the same things from life that Americans want. It is an error to assume others will react the same way as we do when faced with opportunities or threats. 
</p>
<p>
    The cited report from Krebs on Security (see references for Russia below) quotes a Russian hacking group as saying their mission is the "re-education of the 'civilized' world." The scare quotes around the word <em>civilized</em> are not accidental. They communicate a great deal about the kind of people we're facing. This kind of thinking makes no sense to Americans or other Westerners.
</p>
<p>
    Hence, Americans were surprised when Russia continued to behave like Russia after the fall of Communism in 1989. They are bemused by Iran's inability to put the past behind them and move forward, and the continuing denunciation of America as the Great Satan. They find the North Koreans' promise to turn Americans into "forlorn, wandering spirits" quaint - <em>funny</em>, even - and fail to grasp the serious threat behind that sort of talk. It's because most Americans have absolutely no concept of these other cultures. 
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    Having considered how the US is responding to cyberwarfare activities on the part of hostile countries, let's fast-forward to a hypothetical future in which the American State has been established and its basic policies have been implemented. How might the State respond differently to similar threats?
</p>
<p>
    As we've mentioned in other blog posts, some of the general conditions of America's relations with other countries would be different under the State system, owing to differences both in domestic law and in foreign policy. 
</p>
<p>
    On the domestic front, our strategy to implement the Three Pillars of Independence includes comprehensive improvements in infrastructure to improve resiliency and survivability of all kinds of facilities that are critical to the country. Under the State system, it will be more difficult for cyberattacks to have far-reaching or lasting effects. We cannot make ourselves immune, but we can take practical steps to ensure continued operation at or near full capacity during any sort of attack, "cyber" or otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    Also on the domestic front, any company that works in an area pertaining to the Three Pillars of Independence must follow regulations. The regulations are not "suggestions." Failure to comply is a Category 1 offense - undermining the Three Pillars of Independence. So, State law has teeth where US law does not.
</p>
<p>
    Internationally, the American State's very different approach to foreign policy is likely to result in improved relations with most countries. That is not to say relations with the four countries in question would be positive, given their propensities. But <em>some</em> improvement is possible - or at least <em>conceivable</em> - especially with respect to China and Iran. This is only a possibility, not an expectation. It's more likely China and Iran will continue to be challenging. With respect to Russia and North Korea, the possibilities are less promising.
</p>

<p>
<em>Chinese cyberwarfare</em>
</p>
<p>
    Given closer collaboration with China to support mutual interests, the State <em>may</em> be able to influence them to halt or scale back cyberattacks against America. We think the probability of this is low, but we do expect the Chinese to respond to diplomatic and economic pressure - even to reasonable discussion - in a way we can comprehend. That isn't to say we can blindly trust them, but they will be playing a game whose rules we can understand.
</p>
<p>
    Of the four, China will be the least difficult for us to understand and work with, and the most open to rational proposals for cooperation. It will not be necessary to remind them that the American State's Legal Code authorizes literally any response to a cyberattack without limitation in terms of the methods or the extent of retaliation. That is implicit. Of the four, only the Chinese are capable of understanding this without explanation or demonstration.
</p>
<p>
    The Chinese tend to pay attention to details and context, and to act pragmatically in their own best interests. They will perceive the material differences between US and American State policy, and we believe they will make adjustments to their own policy accordingly, both to enjoy the benefits of cooperation and to avoid the potential consequences of continued hostile action.
</p>

<p>
<em>Iranian cyberwarfare</em>
</p>
<p>
    The American State is not the United States. We see ourselves as a new country with a fresh start, even if others may disagree and continue to seek retribution against us for past wrongs (real or imagined). We categorically disavow responsibility for harm caused by past US foreign policy, including the actions of the US in 1907 and 1953 to protect petroleum company interests in Iran. If the Iranians accept this, we may be on better terms with Iran than the present-day US. 
</p>
<p>
    We think the probability of this is low due to the fact much of the popular support for the Islamist government is built on a foundation of hatred against America. Most people in Iran don't really know what "America" is, and won't differentiate between the US and the American State. In a land of many tribes, cultures, and languages, bordering directly on the hordelands (Afghanistan and the Pakistani "tribal area"), the "common enemy" strategy helps the Persians hold everything together. 
</p>
<p>
    It would be difficult for their leaders to change their anti-American position and still maintain power. Hatred for America has become ingrained and automatic in most Iranians. The hate that once served as an excuse for the Islamic Revolution may now be so deeply entrenched that it cannot change, even if the ostensible reasons for it have ceased to exist.
</p>
<p>
    Lacking effective diplomatic or economic means to influence them, we can exercise the option to respond physically to a cyberattack from Iran with low risk of escalation to a hot war, given the extreme imbalance of military power between the two countries. Even if a hot war occurs, it may have been inevitable anyway, and the response to cyberattacks may simply be the final straw in the ongoing friction between the two countries. It would be better to get it over with than to allow hostilities to drag on endlessly.
</p>

<p>
<em>Russian cyberwarfare</em>
</p>
<p>
    We consider Russian cyberwarfare to be the most dangerous for America.
</p>
<p> 
    Over the course of some 1,100 years of history, Russia has demonstrated consistently aggressive and untrustworthy behavior. The United States has been their primary adversary since 1917, but they always have been and always will be a threat to all other countries. 
</p>
<p>
    Of the four in question, Russian culture is the only one that did not evolve from one of the Axial Age civilizations. The Russians come from the hordelands civilization, like the Avars, Mongols, and Chechens. That civilization lacks the philosophical foundations of South Asian, Middle Eastern, and East Asian civilizations. 
</p>
<p>
    The cultures arising from the hordelands have a tribal mentality. What passes for "philosophy" goes something like this: "If your neighbor is weak right now, that's good luck for you so take advantage of it. Next year, they might do the same to you. That's just bad luck. There's no right or wrong. There are the strong and the weak, and that's all. We may be weak today and strong tomorrow. When we are strong, we <em>take</em>. When we are weak, we <em>survive</em>."  
</p>
<p>
    If that sounds a bit like the philosophy of a wild animal, there may be good reason to think so. The bear is often cited as the national animal of Russia, or at least as a symbol of Russia. While this is not literally or officially the case, the bear does provide a pretty good metaphor for Russia. When we meet a bear in the wild, it may or may not kill us. We may or may not understand its reasons. We may or may not be able to influence its decision by behaving in certain ways. We may <em>think</em> our behavior caused the bear to walk away, and that we have learned how to interact effectively with bears, when in reality it left for reasons of its own and we learned nothing. If the bear proves friendly today, that carries no weight for future encounters with the same animal. That's Russia in a nutshell; or in a bear suit.
</p>
<p>
    We consider this to be the main reason their actions often surprise Americans, whose culture derives from Middle Eastern civilization - one of the Axial Age civilizations that developed philosophy as we understand it, through an unbroken line 10,000 years long from Mesopotamia to Persia to Egypt to Greece to Rome to Europe to America. The actions of Russians and of the Russian government often seem irrational, random, or self-destructive from our perspective. We have little chance of anticipating their reactions to any given stimulus except within a narrowly-defined context and over a short time span.
</p>
<p>
    A peculiarity of the Russians is that they view themselves as a distinct civilization rather than as "just" a country, and believe they are chosen by God to dominate the world. They are on a short list of peoples the rest of the world regards as insufferably arrogant. We can't complain about that <em>per se</em> for the obvious reason, but we can and must keep it in mind when engaging with them.
</p>
<p>
    Russia will always require special handling in diplomatic relations, but they have shown that they can respect "strength," as they understand the concept. In contrast with US policy to respond to cyberattacks in kind, the flexibility of the American State to physically destroy facilities and kill personnel will resonate with the Russians' tribal mentality. We expect we will have to demonstrate our willingness to respond in this way, but we believe they will stand off after the first such response.
</p>

<p>
<em>North Korean cyberwarfare</em>
</p>
<p>
    The situation of North Korea is unique. A lingering remnant of a decades-old cease-fire in a war that has never officially ended, North Korea is less a nation-state than a mafia operation run by the Kim family. 
</p>
<p>
    The North Koreans are liable to act irrationally and unpredictably, and with no regard for human life or regional stability, very much in the manner of gangsters. In addition, they have shown little willingness to discuss matters or to honor any agreements they might make. The constant threat of war and the inculcation of fear of external enemies help them hold power.
</p>
<p>
    As with Iran, the power imbalance with America is huge. We can eliminate their facilities and qualified personnel with very low risk. This is probably the only way to stop cyberattacks from North Korea.
</p>
<p>
    Such a response is unlikely to lead to a larger conflict. China will value the improved relations with America. We can exchange assurances to uphold the One China policy for their neutrality, and possibly even their assistance in suppressing North Korea. They have rapidly built up a modern military force and are looking for opportunities to harden it with combat experience. 
</p>
<p>
    This would be a good situation for their army to gain some combat experience at low cost, as the North Koreans can put up only minor resistance. Besides, as many as half will surrender immediately for the same general reason as Saddam Hussein's elite forces surrendered - they're tired of living as they do now.
</p>
<p>
    Russia will be stretching its resources to deal with conflicts in eastern Europe (if not Ukraine then someone else) and Africa (e.g., fighting Boko Haram in Nigeria - the deal they made for Nigeria's support in the Ukrainian genocide). North Korea was important to the USSR in its rivalry with the US, but is not important for relations between modern Russia and the American State, neither of which was a participant in the Cold War.
</p>
<p>
    Iran will have its hands full with Israel, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and must devote some of its attention to Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia - all much closer at hand than distant Korea. Iran supports North Korea as a matter of convenience, and not because they are willing to make sacrifices on North Korea's behalf. North Korea does not enjoy broad international support, even among other bad actors.
</p>

<h3>Is a kinetic response overkill for a cyberattack?</h3>

<p>
    Many recoil at the idea of launching missiles in response to a cyberattack. After all, cyber-crime is just young people playing with computers, isn't it? Is it worth starting a war over that?
</p>
<p>
    Think of it this way: Say a foreign country fired a missile that destroyed your town's municipal water facility. Your children now have no clean water to drink, and you have no supply of water for cooking or washing. What sort of response would you expect...no, <em>demand</em> from your government?
</p>
<p>
    A cyberattack that shuts down the same municipal water facility is <em>identical</em> to a missile strike. The American State's response has to be <em>identical</em> to that for a missile attack. We are not starting a war over it. The war has already begun.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the State system puts America in a stronger position to deal with cyberwarfare than the US system by increasing the resiliency and recoverability of critical infrastructure, by consolidating and coordinating the management of infrastructure under a central authority, and by allowing the use of physical force in response to cyberattacks.
