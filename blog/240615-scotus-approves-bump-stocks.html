<h1>SCOTUS Approves Bump Stocks</h1>

<p>
    15 Jun 2024
</p>

<p>
    A <em>bump stock</em> is an attachment that can be fitted to a long gun that uses the recoil energy of the weapon to bounce or "bump" the trigger against the user's finger, enabling rapid fire. In response to a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017 in which the perpetrator used bump stocks to kill 58 and injure many more at a music festival, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) issued a ban on bump stocks in 2019. 
</p>
<p>
    A gun shop owner and gun rights activist in Austin, Texas, Michael Cargill, challenged the ban in court on the grounds the ATF had misinterpreted the longstanding law against machine guns to include semiautomatic weapons fitted with bump stocks. The court upheld his claim and the matter was escalated to the US Supreme Court. The six SCOTUS members who are extremists under the sway of the Republican Party voted to overturn the ban. 
</p>
<p>
    In effect, a bump stock makes a semiautomatic rifle operate in a fully-automatic manner, even if technically the rifle is not a "machine gun." This is a word game. In our view, the capability of a weapon is what matters, and not its design or construction. We consider a semiautomatic rifle fitted with a bump stock to have no legitimate civilian use. Its only potential use is to slaughter people, as in the Las Vegas incident.
</p>
<p>
    To get a sense of the kind of people who approve of mass slaughter, consider: 
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>The legal challenge to the ATF ban came from a virulent gun "rights" activist who has a vested financial interest in selling weapons and who lives in one of the most extreme fascist states in the US.</li>
        <li>The SCOTUS justices who upheld the challenge are all puppets of the Republican fascist movement who have track records of undermining legal protections for Americans and of accepting gifts and bribes for their services.</li>
        <li>Kyle Rittenhouse, the murderer who transported an AR-15 across state lines while still a minor, whose acquittal was orchestrated by a partisan judge who closely controlled the evidence and testimony that was allowed in trial, and who has been widely celebrated by the most extreme elements of the fascist movement, posted on X that he was very pleased with the SCOTUS ruling and received many "likes" and retweets from extremist organizations and activists.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This represents a growing trend in the US, and is exactly the reason Americans need to reconsider their system of government.
</p>

<h3>How would this play out under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    Statutes pertaining to firearms and the constitutional framing for those statutes are very different in the US system and the American State system. 
</p>
<p>
    In the US system, the 2nd amendment to the Constitution specifies a state's right to maintain a militia. The original intent was to enable slave states to raise slave patrols to recover runaways. The union was fragile, and the central government had to placate state governments that had a wide range of perspectives and desires. Over time, the interpretation of the amendment has evolved to mean individual Americans have the right to own firearms. Americans have come to regard firearms as a unique type of item, different from anything else.
</p>
<p>
    There are some legal limitations on the types of weapons individual civilians may own. In general, military-grade weapons are prohibited; but certain types of military-style weapons are allowed. For the most part, common sense prevails. For instance, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher is not considered appropriate for civilian use. Similarly, machine guns are prohibited for civilians, and rifles that have a fully-automatic firing mode must be modified so that mode is disabled. 
</p>
<p>
    Under the American State system, firearms are not considered unique as such, but they are categorized as "dangerous items" because they are inherently dangerous even when used properly. Dangerous items, as a category, are subject to oversight by qualified standards organizations that are usually independent of the government. That is, they are managed at the <em>regulatory</em> level and not the <em>statutory</em> or <em>constitutional</em> levels. 
</p>
<p>
    The use of dangerous items is considered a <em>privilege</em> rather than a <em>right</em>. Users must hold the relevant license to operate any sort of dangerous item. Depending on the nature of the item, this may include mental health screening, training in the safe operation of the item, and certification or licensure. In some cases, the license may have to be renewed periodically. 
</p>
<p>
    One example is the requirement to have a driver's license in order to operate a car. You have to pass some fairly simple training and demonstrate that you can operate a car properly. Every few years you have to renew the license. Under the State system, all dangerous items would have similar requirements. 
</p>
<p>
    In keeping with Kindergarten Wisdom and the desire to maximize individual liberty, the State is concerned with the use of dangerous items in situations that may cause harm to the general public. The State has no interest in your use of dangerous items by yourself on your own property. In that situation, if you harmed yourself because you didn't really know what you were doing, you would be considered to have exercised your <em>free choice of reckless action</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Consider a person who lives on or runs a ranch. They may have a registered vehicle and a license to drive it. They use the vehicle to drive into town for supplies, and for any other general purpose. They may also have an unregistered vehicle they use only on the ranch. They never take that vehicle onto a public roadway. They aren't required to register or insure that vehicle. They aren't required to pass any sort of driver training to operate the vehicle on their own property.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, they may have a registered handgun for self defense and a license to carry it. They bring the handgun with them when they go about their personal business in public. They may also have an unregistered rifle or shotgun that they use only on the ranch, to deal with "critters" and to defend their land from trespassers. They never take those weapons beyond their own property line. They aren't required to register them or to have a license to use them. They aren't required to pass any sort of firearms safety training to use the weapons privately.
</p>
<p>
    Could the rancher also own a military-style semiautomatic rifle such as an AR-15? That would depend on the standards set by the independent organization responsible for defining regulations. The requirements, if any, are not specifically stated in the Legal Code. Even so, some common sense limitations are likely. For instance, owning an AR-15 for private use is no problem, but owning 100 of them and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition suggests something about intent that would definitely be of interest to the State.
</p>
<p>
    The State system makes other allowances for firearms ownership and use. The owner of a shooting range may wish to offer machine guns and other exotic weapons to their customers on a rental basis while they're on the premises. The customers need not have firearms licenses to rent and use such weapons in that context. 
</p>
<p>
    It might seem as if the State is fairly lenient about firearms. It comes down to the emphasis on individual liberty, personal responsibility, and the definition of a legal offense as <em>doing harm to someone</em>. As long as you do no harm to others, the State does not care what products you own. An exception is a case like the person who owns 100 AR-15s, because there is a strong indication of malicious intent. 
</p>
<p>
    Another detail that might surprise those who assume the State system is "leftist" is the fact the independent standards-setting organization responsible for firearms regulations would almost certainly be the National Rifle Association (NRA). That organization has the most expertise about firearms of any independent civilian organization in the country. They also offer the highest-quality firearms safety training of any civilian organization. 
</p>
<p>
    NRA leadership <em>circa</em> 2024 is closely associated with the Republican-led fascist movement, but that is not a permanent condition. By the time the Transition is completed, extremists with an anti-American mindset would have chosen either to relocate to the Confederacy or to accept the reality of living under the rule of law in America. Given leaders who uphold American values, we believe the NRA can provide responsible regulation without extremism. If they can't, then either the National Council or the people, through the petition process, can replace them.
