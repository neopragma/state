This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Concerns About Artifcial Intelligence: Differences Between US and State Law</h1>

<p>
    23 May 2024
</p>

<p>
    There's a lot of discussion about the downsides of artificial intelligence (AI). The <em>Forbes</em> article cited in the references lists 15 risks:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lack of transparency</li>
        <li>Bias and discrimination</li>
        <li>Privacy concerns</li>
        <li>Ethical dilemmas</li>
        <li>Security risks</li>
        <li>Concentration of power</li>
        <li>Dependence on AI</li>
        <li>Job displacement</li>
        <li>Economic inequality</li>
        <li>Legal and regulatory challenges</li>
        <li>AI arms race</li>
        <li>Loss of human connection</li>
        <li>Misinformation and manipulation</li>
        <li>Unintended consequences</li>
        <li>Existential risks</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    While there is some overlap in these issues, there are several distinct risks in the list. 
</p>
<p>
    Another concern is the way human labor is being exploited to present the appearance that AI is working well, when in fact it doesn't come close to living up to the hype. Some of the technical limitations are discussed in the <em>Scientific American</em> article cited below, while the human labor issue is described in the <em>Wired</em> article.
</p>
<p>
    The sheer amount of computer processing power needed to support large-scale AI operations consumes massive quantities of electricity and clean water, at a moment in history when climate change threatens to reduce supplies of clean water for human use. The <em>Popular Science</em> article cited below is just one report among many of this problem.
</p>
<p>
    There seems to be no way to stop the commercial juggernaut that is eating the planet in order to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to influence people's purchasing decisions - a pretty trivial goal compared to the overall cost to humanity.
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    The situation with AI provides an excellent example of the effect of one key difference between present-day US law and State law. Under US law, the letter of the law prevails over the intent of the law. Under State law, the intent of the law prevails over the letter. 
</p>
<p>
    There are really only two things that are crimes in the American State. One is to undermine the system that enables our freedom. The other is to cause harm to any person other than oneself. All the concerns about AI <em>circa</em> 2024 are covered by these aspects of State law.
</p>
<p> 
    The US is thrashing as lawmakers try to make the letter of the law catch up with technological developments. Bad actors stay ahead of lawmakers by using ever more advanced technological "tricks" to harm people. 
</p>
<p>
    In the American State, we don't have to change the letter of the law to match changes in criminals' methods or tools. It makes no difference <em>how</em> a perpetrator causes harm; the question is <em>whether</em> they cause harm. That's all.
