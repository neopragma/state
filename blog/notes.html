<h1>How Should (or Can) America Stand for Human Rights Worldwide?</h1>

<p>
    15 August 2022
</p>

<p>
    Discussions of this general topic as it relates to the State model touch on several related subjects and raise a number of questions, including:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is or is not a "human right?" Is there a generally-accepted definition of the concept?</li>
        <li>Do human rights have to be earned or paid for, or are they called "human" rights because they are intrinsic to human beings, like bones and blood? If rights must be earned or paid for, then why not call them "privileges" instead? Is that not more honest? Does the dishonesty bother anyone?</li>
        <li>Is it possible <em>at all</em> to uphold human rights under a hybrid authoritarian-democratic political system such as the one we propose, or do the limitations on full democracy that we have defined as a hedge against "mass stupidity" amount to human rights violations in themselves? If so, then what are we trading off - what do we gain in exchange for limiting rights? Does the value we obtain exceed the cost?</li>
        <li>Given its history, does the United States (or its inheritor, the American State) have legitimacy to criticize human rights abuses elsewhere in the world?</li>
        <li>If America chooses to step in and act in a foreign country in defense of human rights, does this create an obligation to step in and act in <em>all human rights crises</em> worldwide, simultaneously? If not, then by what criteria should America pick and choose its human rights battles?</li>
        <li>Is it legitimate for America to cite "human rights" as the excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, when the true reason is something else (access to resources, control of shipping lanes, creating a "common enemy" to unify Americans who are divided against each other, etc.)? Why not simply state the true reason(s)? Does the dishonesty bother anyone?</li>
        <li>Is it worth the cost of going to war to defend human rights in another country? This is the unpleasant but necessary question, "What's in it for us?"</li>
        <li>Does it matter to us if foreigners perceive America as "tough" on issues of civil rights and freedom? What happens if they don't? Is American independence or the individual liberty of its people affected by this perception?</li>
        <li>Is it credible for America to insist that a region generally regarded as part of a foreign country be treated as if it were an independent country in one case (e.g., Taiwan) while simultaneously acceding to other countries' claims on regions whose populations demand their own state (e.g., the Kurds) and also holding territories whose populations want independence (e.g., Puerto Rico)? Does the hypocrisy bother anyone?</li>
        <li>Does the Cold War model of a world divided into "democratic" and "authoritarian" governments still hold in the 21st century? Is there a fully democratic government anywhere on the planet? Who decides which governments qualify as "democratic enough," by what criteria, and by what authority?</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>What is or is not a "human right?" Must human rights be "earned?"</h3>

<p>
    Up to the date of publication of this post, it seems as if everyone who has offered constructive suggestions or who has criticized the State model: 
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) has not read our Backgrounder on the subject of human rights or any other published documents on the subject, such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the Bill of Rights (the first 10 amendments to the US Constitution), and in some cases was unaware of the existence of such documents (see References below); or</li>
        <li>(b) has read one or more documents about the subject of human rights, but did not understand what they read; or</li>
        <li>(c) freely mixes human rights, legal/civil rights, and privileges as if they were all in the same category; or</li>
        <li>(c) prefers their own definition of "human rights," which at times can seem a little surprising to us, as <em>ad hoc</em> definitions often vary considerably from the generally-known published ones, and are based on assumptions that are unfamiliar to us and that are rarely, if ever explained to set the stage for the opinions to follow.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    When we are not working from a common set of definitions, it is difficult to discuss a subject because most of the apparent disagreements turn out to be differences in the understanding of words rather than differences in substance. For that reason, we will begin this post by referring the reader to the <em>Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</em>. We think (hope?) the explanation given there is reasonably clear. It is possible we went overboard in dissecting the concept in our attempt to arrive at a solid-enough definition to serve as one of the underpinnings of the State model. We think (hope?) we have been able to distinguish clearly among the ideas of human needs, human rights, legal rights and civil rights, and privileges. In discussing the subject, we hope people will be able to stay focused on human rights, and they can separate the other related concepts. 
</p>
<p>
    Another curiosity in the way people approach the subject of human rights is that they sometimes elevate the "topic of the day" to the level of a <em>human right</em>, apparently as a way to boost the importance of that topic in other people's minds. Yet, every law that people may be fighting for isn't automatically a "human right" just because it is a good idea. There are a <em>lot</em> of good ideas out there, and every single one of them isn't a human right. 
</p>
<p>
    "A livable minimum wage is a human right!" Is it? Or is a livable minimum wage one possible way to support other human rights, such as the right to life and the right to have a place to live? Is it our goal to make the minimum wage a "right," or is the minimum wage a means to an end? You can't have a wage if you don't have a job. Is a job a human right? It makes sense to us to talk about a right to work, but not to say actually having a job with a paycheck is a right. There is no practical way to make that a reality.
</p>
<p>
    We believe a <em>human right</em> is something every human being is entitled to by virtue of the fact they are a human being. They don't have to qualify, earn, pay for, or be granted a human right. No one can "give" anyone their human rights; everyone already has them. No one can "take away" their human rights; no matter what crimes they commit, they remain human. Other rights and privileges and various strategies to support human rights may be important and desirable, but they are not part of the inherent characteristics of a human being as such. 
</p>
<p>
    For example, under the State system anyone charged with a crime has the right to a timely trial. That is not a human right, it is a legal right. The State grants that right in the Constitution and the Legal Code, and the State can change it through a legislative procedure. Many people may enjoy the privilege to drive a car; that is neither a human right nor a legal right. It is an activity a person can engage in if and only if they fulfill certain obligations, such as driver training and licensure. On the other hand, everyone has the right not to be murdered. That is a human right; the State did not grant it - every human being already has that right, in the same sense as they have blood and bones - and the State cannot legislate it away or deny it through an adminstrative procedure. 
</p>
<p>
    A third issue in many discussions is <em>synecdoche</em> - comparing two things that are at different levels of abstraction. On the subject of rights, people sometimes assert that a specific example of the exercise of a right is, itself, a "right." This might seem like a trivial distinction, but it can lead to a problem: Should we forget to mention a specific exercise of a right, it might be understood to mean people cannot exercise the right in that manner. So, it is useful to be clear about the definition of a right and the various things people might do to exercise that right.
</p>
<p>
    A common example is the right to an abortion. People who disagree about the right of abortion often express themselves in absolute terms - abortion is a human right, or God prohibits abortion in all circumstances. Neither extreme viewpoint is correct. We consider that the choice of abortion is a specific example of the exercise of the human right to manage one's own healthcare. Healthcare is the right; abortion is just one example of a healthcare choice one might make. If we list abortion specifically as the "right" in question, then we omit the right to choose to end one's life to avoid years of pain and deterioration with a debilitating illness. If we recognize that both those examples are <em>exercises</em> of the same right - the right to manage one's own healthcare choices - then there is less ambiguity about just what the "right" really is. The right itself, and a particular <em>exercise</em> of that right, are not the same thing.
</p>

<h3>Is it possible to uphold human rights without "full" democracy?</h3>

<p>
    One question that has been raised in discussions about human rights and the State model is whether it is posslble for any form of government other than full democracy to uphold human rights. Any degree of authoritarianism is seen as a threat to people's freedom and rights. 
</p>
<p>
    Our response is two-fold. First, no system exists today that is fully democratic, and such a system is probably not realistic for a population larger than a few hundred people. Second, the results of the 2016 election and the still-ongoing attempts to subvert democracy demonstrate that the voters in the US cannot handle full democracy; if left to their own devices, they will burn down the house they live in while they are inside it, cheering and waving the flag the whole time. 
</p>
<p>
    The US is already a hybrid authoritarian-democratic system. Every voter in the US is not asked to offer an opinion about every matter before the government. If you check the sheer number of work items before the US Congress (see <a href="https://www.congress.gov/browse">https://www.congress.gov/browse</a>), the US Supreme Court (see <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/20">https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/20</a>), and the number of Executive Orders signed by Presidents (see <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders">https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders</a>), it will surely be obvious that it is impractical to ask every registered voter in the United States to weigh in on every matter. Many of these matters require specialized expertise and/or deep study just to understand their context and the implications of different possible decisions. Add to that the volume of work in all 50 state governments. There is simply no time for full democracy. There are too many people for that, too many conflicting interests in play, and too many potential domino effects of a poorly-informed decision.
</p>
<p>
    Today, Americans vote for representatives who then act without bringing every decision before the voters. Beyond that, at the federal level the people have effectively no voice in the selection of the President and Vice President, due to the Electoral College system, which is highly susceptible to corrupt partisan machinations at the state level. Further alienating voters from the government, the winner-takes-all voting system limits choices to pre-selected candidates who are servants of the power elite, and forces all voters into one of two "big tents." Very few voters have the option to choose exactly what they really support or want. In effect, Americans choose the lesser of two evils, insofar as they can even tell a difference, and then hope for the best. Once the elected representatives are in place, they are influenced by professional lobbyists and pushed toward the extremes in an attempt to win re-election. Is that full democracy? Is it preferable to the proposed State system?
</p>
<p>
    Historically, the US has not been a champion of human rights. The only reason workers today enjoy any protection from abuse by employers is that labor movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries forced the hand of the power elite by shutting down business on a large scale through coordinated strikes. There has never been anything inherent in the US Constitutional system that protected ordinary people from whatever abuses the power elite might dream up, from slavery to child labor to machine-gunning striking workers. 
</p>
<p>
    When we declare the State to be a hybrid system, it does not imply we are taking anything away from the American people. The difference is that we are honest about the fact the system is a hybrid. In some respects, it is more democratic than the present-day US system; in other respects, less so. 
</p>
<p>
    It is more democratic in that more matters are brought before the people for a direct vote. Almost anything that might affect Americans' day to day lives in a material way is subject to their vote. The exception is matters that might undermine the Three Pillars of Independence; and that is the system that ensures Americans' freedom over the long term, so it is hardly a restriction of their rights. 
</p>
<p>
    It is less democratic in that the people elect members to the National Advisory Board, but not directly to the National Council - the national decision-making body responsible for keeping the system afloat and for handling international affairs. That is one hedge against an outbreak of mass stupidity. Another is the weighted voting system, in which citizens who are fully invested in the system have a greater voice than those who choose to withdraw themselves from portions of the system. That is meant to reduce the probability that people who don't really want to be part of America in the first place will use their voting power to tear down the system for everyone else. 
</p>
<p>
    We believe this system stands a <em>better</em> chance of upholding human rights for all the people than a fully democratic system in which selfishness would lead the voters to make choices against their own interests, as the present system does.
</p>

<h3>Does America have legitimacy to criticize human rights abuses in other countries?</h3>

<p>
    In the <em>Backgrounder on International Relations</em>, we declare the intention of the State to stay out of the internal affairs of other countries. We propose to shift away from the existing Bretton Woods system and implement foreign policy based on the emerging global order. Our rationale is that by trying to <em>force</em> the Bretton Woods agreements to continue in an era that has very different characteristics from the post World War II era, we will not only fail but will damage our country in the attempt. It is time to leave the 20th century behind.
</p>
<p>
    One of the ways the US government has garnered domestic support for military interventions and economic sanctions around the world has been to claim the objective was to oppose human rights abuses in the other countries. Today, as practical concerns lead us to consider new international alignments not based on Cold War political delineations, some critics of our model have recoiled at the idea of doing business with governments that have poor human rights records. They are accustomed to thinking of the US as the Good Guys. More often, the US is the Not Always Entirely Bad Guys, but that is not the message that is fed to the American people throughout their childhoods. 
</p>
<p>
    When we point out that the US also has a poor human rights record - from genocide and forced relocations of indigenous peoples, to slaughtering millions of civilians in the conquest of the Phillippines, to suppressing voting rights at home, to executions for "disloyalty" following fake trials without evidence, to systematically oppressing blacks for centuries - these critics insist the fact we have a poor human rights record does not require us to shut up about other countries' civil rights abuses. We agree in principle, but we must ask, wouldn't our country's credibility be enhanced if we cleaned up our own house? 
</p>
<p>
    It's easy enough to claim a "right to speak out." But how do calls for human rights sound when they come from a human rights abuser? It seems to us our voice in support of human rights would be stronger if we came from a position of honesty. Currently, Republicans are passing laws at the state level to censor public school curricula and, in some cases, to suppress the first amendment rights of teachers and students, in an attempt to avoid or deny the nation's true history. How can we credibly commit to self-improvement and present ourselves as a genuine champion of human rights if we refuse even to face up to our history honestly?
</p>
<p>
     They are also busily stripping people of human rights, such as the woman's right to choose abortion as a healthcare matter, even to the extent of forcing women to carry dead fetuses to term; and some are even calling for anyone who promotes the use of vaccines to combat disease should be executed for "crimes against humanity." How can such a country speak out credibly in support of human rights?
 </p>

<h3>How do we pick and choose human rights crises?</h3>

<p>
    Some critics of the State model call out inconsistency - even hypocrisy - when we claim to base the system on human rights while also desiring to form a working partnership with China, an egregious human rights abuser. We consider the scope or jurisdiction of the State to be America. The foundation of human rights concerns Americans' human rights. Sorry to be so blunt. Economically, a partnership between America and China would be a practical basis to maintain stability, prosperity, and peace in the post-Bretton Woods world. We would do well, going forward, to address our own human rights practices, and to try and influence partner countries in a positive way. But our first concern has to be establishing the new system and stabilizing it. 
</p>
<p>
    We asked these critics, if they are so keen to face up to China on human rights issues, does this imply we are obligated to take a direct hand in every other human rights crisis in the world? This would be a big job (see References below). They said America would have to pick and choose which crises to address; and we agree. In that case, why China? If our national interests are better served by collaboration with China, wouldn't it make more sense to choose another crisis to focus on for human rights reasons, and possibly use it as a vehicle to build a cooperative relationship with partners that offer greater value to us? 
</p>

<h3>Cold War thinking</h3>

<p>
    The present-day US government still characterizes the world as divided inexorably between "authoritarian" and "democratic states." In reality, all governments are a blend of approaches and systems. Some are partially democratic while others are far toward the authoritarian end of the spectrum. Complicating matters, some are in a period of transition or development, moving <em>toward</em> more democratic structures and processes. The US government is inconsistent in recognizing and encouraging governments for progress toward democracy. It seems to be another area in which the government picks its alliances and whom to support based on national interest, decorated in words associated with human rights, democracy, and freedom. 
</p> 
<p>
    The State system continues to make foreign policy decisions based primarily on our own national interest. The difference is we understand the Cold War is over, and the members of the Bretton Woods system are changing - most have aging and declining populations, and will become weaker nation-states over the next few decades. At the same time, other countries are poised to make rapid strides economically, militarily, and politically. To remain relevant and powerful, America has to change with the times. 
</p>
<p>
    We cannot fix everyone's human rights issues regardless of the cost to ourselves. It would be a beautiful world if that were feasible. We need to take care of our internal problems, establish new alliances, and stabilize the emerging world order. Until those tasks are complete, our human rights focus has to be domestic. We simply do not have unlimited resources.
</p>
