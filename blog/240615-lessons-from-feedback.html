This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Lessons from Feedback</h1>

<p>
    15 June 2024
</p>

<p>
    As people have started to read about the proposed American State, we've been receiving feedback. We're glad to consider feedback, as it helps us refine the model. It's likely we've overlooked things and expressed ideas in ways that are unclear. 
</p>

<h3>Form (or format) over substance</h3>

<p>
    So far, we haven't received feedback that addresses the core ideas of the model. Comments have been more about the presentation of the ideas. Even then, information about how we might improve the presentation is indirect. We've been able to glean a few things people did not state directly, but implied by the content and tone of their comments.
</p>
<p>
    The general pattern of comments to date has been that a reader skimmed part of the material and saw (or failed to see) something of interest within the first few seconds of reading. Then they reacted in an extreme way to what they perceived to be an idea they didn't like or an omission of something they felt was important. 
</p>
<p>
    In all cases so far, the detail they were looking for was already covered. In all cases so far, the idea they misread or assumed was missing was actually in alignment with their own views. They didn't see it immediately, in their initial quick read of selected paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
    To address that problem, we simplified the index page. We removed most of the text from that page. Hopefully, the resulting verbage has a clear focus on the core idea of the model - that Americans want to maximize their own individual liberty in a sustainable way, and we want to think about practical ways to enable that outcome. 
</p>
<p>
    One person suggested we state the idea he liked up front, and not bury it in the details. We don't object to doing that, of course, but what about the ideas other people liked? So far, each person has latched onto a different detail. It isn't feasible to state <em>every</em> idea up front. Some things can't be described in a sound bite or a tweet-sized phrase. The whole question of "America" is far too complicated for that. 
</p>

<h3>Implications of the general pattern of responses</h3>

<p>
    Following up with each commenter, we were able to resolve misunderstandings and show where the details of interest were covered in the documents. Yet, a couple of general observations - unrelated to the details of the comments - fall out from the pattern of responses. 
</p>
<p>
    First, in every case the reader <em>skimmed</em> the material and reached pretty strong conclusions about the entire model based on that light and incomplete reading. This suggests the phenomenon of short attention spans, which has been attributed to social media and continuous connectivity, is real. Even intelligent, thoughtful people fall victim to the tendency to <em>skim</em> instead of <em>read</em>.
</p>
<p>
    What can we do about that? We can try to express our ideas more concisely. Even so, as already mentioned, the subject matter doesn't lend itself to a "tl;dr" presentation. Those who will not read for more than a few minutes will simply not understand how the numerous puzzle pieces fit together. They will tend to stop as soon as they encounter something that triggers them. 
</p>
<p>
    About <em>that</em> we can do nothing. The best we can do is to leave the material out there for people to read if they so choose. Some, however few, <em>will</em> take the time to read more than a couple of sentences. We await <em>their</em> feedback eagerly.
</p>
<p>
    Second, in every case the reader's <em>initial reaction</em> was to condemn and vilify the authors in strong terms, even though there was no substance or accuracy to their judgments. 
</p>
<p>
    What can we do about that? Until now, we've been able to engage the commenters constructively and smooth over their initial negative reactions. But this will not always be possible. We think it's in the nature of social media. People tend to be judgmental and harsh, and to say things they would never dare to say to <em>anyone</em> face to face. We can only try to be patient and keep repeating our message.
</p>

<h3>Specific concerns</h3>

<p>
    Let's mention a few specific concerns that readers have mentioned. 
</p>
<p>
    <em>Individual liberty and personal responsibility</em>
</p>
<p>
    One person reacted to the phrase <em>individual liberty</em> in a negative way. He commented that we mention "rights" quite a lot but we didn't seem to mention "responsibility" or "duty." He assumed the model did not consider personal responsibility, and thought it advocated unfettered, irresponsible individual liberty. 
</p>
<p>
    Through continued interaction, we were able to clarify that the model has the linked concepts of individual liberty and personal responsibility baked in at multiple levels. 
</p>
<p>
    The parable of the coin comes up repeatedly. You see a shiny coin on the ground and you decide you want it. When you pick it up, you discover there's no way to obtain the shiny side without also taking ownership of the scratched, dirty side that had been in contact with the ground. 
</p>
<p>
    The entire legal system is based on the idea of accountability for the harm you cause others. You enjoy more individual liberty than is the case under the present-day US system. You are also held to account for the outcomes of your choices in ways that go beyond the present-day system. Greater freedom means greater responsibility, as well.
</p>
<p>
    Not only do we mention the word "responsibility," but we recommend a particular model of personal responsibility - Christopher Avery's. It is included in the State's public school curriculum and is covered in "welcome" education for adult immigrants. We don't stop at expressing a philosophical position about responsibility; we apply a specific model of personal responsibility in a deliberate and practical way.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Social services and social safety net</em>
</p>

<p>
    Another person commented that the proposed system did not support any social services. He worried that while people might be "free," many would only be free to die.  
</p>
<p>
    Through continued interaction, we were able to clarify that the model supports quite a few protections for "regular" or "ordinary" people against abuses by the wealthy elite, corporations, and the government itself. Labor laws, tax laws, and social services are all oriented toward the needs of "regular" people. The law includes provisions for employers to cover childcare expenses and to provide parental leave with partial salary continuation and a guarantee of job security. 
</p>
<p>
    At the same time, the system accommodates the preferences of Americans who see themselves as self-sufficient. They can opt out of three key social services and the income taxes that pay for them. These are basic healthcare services, the government pension plan, and the  guaranteed minimum income.
</p>
<p>
    Pensions and healthcare are not connected with one's employer; they are tax-supported options. People are free to opt in and out of these services, and the associated taxes, as many times as they want throughout their adult lives. The level of each benefit for which they are eligible may depend on how many years they opted in, but they can have access to all these benefits if they choose.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Establishment of the Confederacy</em>
</p>

<p>
    Regarding the idea of separating the country into America and the Confederacy, we received negative feedback focusing on different aspects. 
</p>
<p>
    One person pointed out that segregation on the basis of ideology was likely to lead to civil war faster than the alternative of graceful separation. We think that concern is valid if the segregation is imposed. In reality, Americans today are segregating themselves based on ideology. The separation of the Confederacy is more an acknowledgment of popular wishes than any sort of imposed solution. 
</p>
<p>
    Another concern was that we were being too generous with the people we called "confederates" (our shorthand term for those who support the Republican fascist movement). Because we use the word "Confederacy," they assumed we intended to give away all the lands that were part of the original Confederate States of America in the 1860s. 
</p>
<p>
    In fact, we only use that word as a convenience. We don't know (or care) what those people may choose to call their country. The lands to be ceded are a subset of the original Confederacy, sufficient to enable them to have a viable nation-state, but not sufficient to harm America. 
</p>
<p>
    It is in the national self-interest of America for the Confederacy to be a viable nation-state. They will be an immediate neighbor with a land border. By staying out of each other's internal affairs, the two countries can be economic and defense partners.
</p>
<p>
    A third person worried that we intended to "tell" or "force" others to move from one country to the other. He even suggested racist movitations on our part. Unfortunately, we were unable to continue the dialogue with him in a constructive way. He simply repeated his initial misunderstanding of the model and condemnation of its authors. 
</p>
<p>
    In fact, in keeping with the core value of individual liberty, everyone would be free to choose which country they preferred to live in. We would not have to force the issue. There is already a movement for conservatives to move from blue states to red states. The movement has enough momentum to provide a lucrative specialized market for real estate and relocation services. 
</p>
<p>
    We have another blog post about it: <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/blog/240418-conservative-move.html">Conservative Move</a>. The post includes links to the company website and to articles about the movement. This is something people are already doing, and not something that has to be forced on anyone. We'll just make it a little more official. We don't think the idea will be as controversial as the commenter assumed; or even as controversial as we initially feared. 
</p>
<p>
    Since the two value systems are irreconcilable, we believe we can get along better as neighbors than as roommates. Until now, we've seen no reason the Confederates would disagree with this. In fact, we expect many Confederates will support the establishment of the American State for that reason alone - they will end up with their own country where they can implement their values without interference from "liberals," and they won't have to repair any damage from a civil war to get started. 
</p>
<p>
    What if a person decided <em>not</em> to move to the "other" country despite personal support for the values of the other country? It's an individual choice like any other, and has natural consequences just as every choice has. 
</p>
<p>
    People choose where to live for a variety of reasons, and "politics" may not be the most important reason for everyone. They may have a local business or a career with a local company. They may have family and friends in the area. They may simply prefer the climate where they currently live. 
</p>
<p>
    It's all good. People have to adapt to living under the rule of law in whichever country they've chosen. Those choosing to live in the American State would be free to disagree with American values. They just wouldn't be free to insurrect. 
</p>
<p>
    For those who chose to live in the Confederacy but who held American values, we have no advice. They would be subject to the laws of the Confederacy and the grassroots actions of their neighbors. That's the natural consequence of their choice. Even so, there may be personal factors they consider more important than political views or social values. 
</p>

<p>
    <em>Democratic values and individual freedom</em>
</p>

<p>
    One commenter initially perceived a conflict between the idea of individual liberty and the idea of democracy. On further discussion, we realized the difference in our perspectives lay in which of the two concepts we regarded as seminal and which as emergent. 
</p>
<p>
    He has the concept of <em>democracy</em> as an "ethos" from which Good Things, like freedom, emerge. We arrive at a form of democracy for the American State by beginning with the goal of maximizing individual liberty on a sustainable basis. It occurs to us that individual liberty will lose traction unless it is supported by the active participation of the people. That leads to democracy in some form, at least. 
</p>
<p>
    He thinks the idea of "democracy" as nothing more than voting for things doesn't capture the essense of the democratic ethos; but that <em>is</em> how we see it - the democratic aspects of the American State are about the right and duty to vote and the right to petition the government. We think something like a democratic ethos is necessary to support sustainable individual liberty, but that it arises or emerges from the pursuit of that liberty. 
</p>
<p>
    Chicken and egg? Either way, we can have eggs for breakfast and chicken for lunch.
</p>

<h3>A little humor</h3>

<p>
    To conclude on a fun note, we'll mention one commenter who said we had not thought through the details. In view of the sheer volume of material already written about the proposed American State and the careful rationale pertaining to numerous specific practical concerns, the comment struck us as surprising, to say the least. 
</p>
<p>
    As far as we know, the only other example of a proposed system of government whose fundamental documents were supported by a set of explanatory essays is that of the United States itself. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of 85 essays under the pen name Publius. The essays provide philosophical and practical arguments in favor of ratification of the (then) proposed Constitution of the United States. Today we call the essays the Federalist Papers.
</p>
<p>
    Two conditions of the era were different from the present. First, the American colonists were breaking away from the rule of a colonialist power. Second, the idea of people forming their own government as opposed to being governed "by force" by a monarch was new at that time. Yet, there are parallels with the documentation describing the American State.
</p>
<p>
    The colonists wrote a document in the general nature of a manifesto which they called the Declaration of Independence, because they were literally declaring independence from their colonialist overlords. Our own Manifesto for America serves a similar purpose - it summarizes some of the problems we seek so solve and states the basic principles of the system we propose to solve them. We don't have to declare independence from anyone.
</p>
<p>
    The colonists also wrote a Constitution and a body of laws based on it. We have done the same. 
</p>
<p>
    The Federalist Papers were conceptually equivalent to our Backgrounders. As of this writing, we have prepared 33 Backgrounders, each of which provides philosophical and practical support for a particular aspect of the Constitution for America and the Legal Code based on it. We need not argue in favor of people forming their own government without a monarch, as the colonials did. In our era, that is not an unusual idea that requires explicit logical defense.
</p>
<p>
    The criticism that we have not thought about the details is surprising. We understand that others may disagree with our approach to this or that detail, but to say we haven't thought about details at all is downright funny.
