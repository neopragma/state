This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Pregnant Women Refused Treatment</h1>

<p>
    19 April 2024
</p>

<p>
    Extremist states have passed legislation criminalizing normal events such as miscarriages and ordinary healthcare services for pregnant women in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Fear of criminal prosecution for providing healthcare services to pregnant women has caused hospitals to refuse to treat them, in case the fetus dies for any reason or proper treatment might include abortion. Either hospital admission staff or security guards turn women away if they appear to be pregnant. 
</p>
<p>
    Ostensibly aimed at protecting the lives of unborn babies, the heavy-handed laws have instead resulted in needless deaths of babies and fetuses. This week, a woman miscarried in the lobby restroom of a Texas hospital after being refused admission. In Florida, a security guard turned a pregnant woman away, and later her fetus' heart stopped beating. In North Carolina, after being refused admission to give birth, a woman delivered her baby in a car with no medical assistance available, and the baby subsequently died. 
</p>
<p>
    These deaths and many more are on the heads of every extremist in the United States who supports misogynistic laws. There is no place for this in any civilized country.
</p>

<h3>How would this be handled under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    This would not happen under the State system. Basic healthcare services are guaranteed. Those who oppose abortion on principle would never be forced to have one. Otherwise, Kindergarten Wisdom says they cannot interfere in anyone <em>else's</em> lives. Period.
</p>
<p>
    In our view, prosecuting doctors for the "crime" of upholding the Hippocratic Oath is barbaric.
