<h1>10-year-old Ohio Rape Victim Denied Abortion</h1>

<p>
    2 July 2022
</p>

<p>
    On Friday, June 24, 2022, in <em>Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization</em>, the US Supreme Court overturned the <em>Roe v Wade</em> ruling from 1973 and the <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v Caseay</em> ruling from 1992, removing federal protection for the right to abortion from American women. States with governments dominated by evangelical Christians immediately began issuing proclamations and taking legal action against medical professionals who have performed abortions in the past, as well as against women seeking abortions.      
</p>
<p>
    One of the first such actions to hit the press was the case of a 10-year-old girl in Ohio. Abortions are banned after week 6 of a pregnancy in Ohio. This is a "tricky" way to prohibit abortions altogether, as pregnancy is officially considered to begin at the start of the woman's last period. Effectively, that means women will not realize they are pregnant until after the 6 week deadline, in almost every case. In this case, the girl discovered she was pregnant 6 weeks and 3 days into the pregnancy.
</p>
<p>

    The girl, among others seeking abortions, traveled to Indiana, where abortions are banned after week 22 of a pregnancy, to have the procedure done. We expect Indiana to act soon to prohibit abortions entirely, as that state is also dominated by evangelical Christians.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Update 8 Aug 2022: The State of Indiana changed their law to prevent all abortions except in cases of rape, incest, and medical emergency. The Ohio girl still may have qualified for the procedure due to the exceptions for rape and incest, but the legislative trend across the US is to limit abortion rights step by step until they are gone.</em>
</p>

<h3>
    How would this situation play out under the State system?
</h3>

<p>
    If the fetus were determined to be medically viable, then it would be considered to have full human rights. By default, the pregnant woman is the healthcare and legal proxy for her unborn child. In this case, the pregnant girl is a minor, and so the healthcare and legal proxy under the State system for both her and her unborn child is the pregnant girl's mother. The healthcare proxy has full rights to make the decision to abort her daughter's pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>
    The State would require a review of the case. The purpose of the review is to ensure the pregnancy had not been terminated in a way that violated other laws. For example, had someone kicked the girl in the stomach in a fit of rage, killing the unborn child, that individual would be charged with murder. As the decision to terminate the pregnancy was based on consideration of all the surrounding circumstances, and the decision was compatible with Utilitarian Ethics (making the choice that causes the least harm overall), there would be no legal implications.
</p>
<h3>
    Discussion points
</h3>
<p>
    In discussing this case with others, an opinion was expressed (strongly) that when the law defines the unborn child as "human," it causes a woman to feel intense guilt when she must terminate a pregnancy. There is also a social stigma associated with ending a human life, even if the circumstances are entirely legal. To mitigate the emotional trauma of abortion and to avoid social stigma, women prefer to categorize the contents of their wombs as "tissue." 
</p>
<p>
    It was also pointed out that men cannot relate to the feelings a woman has when she is pregnant. We respect this position, but we cannot ignore or sidestep any particular issue when crafting a model for the State. 
</p>
<p>
    The argument that men cannot feel as women do, and therefore must have no opinion on the subject of abortion, feels compelling. It is literally true that men cannot feel as women feel. However, the US Supreme Court had three female members at the time it rendered the decision in <em>Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization</em>, two of whom have a long history of opposition to abortion rights. 
</p>
<p>
    A fourth female justice was sworn in shortly after that decision, with the result that 50% of the female justices oppose abortion rights. This tells us there is no single "women's point of view" that is the same for all American women. Men, for their part, also do not share a single point of view. Logically, then, it is not reasonable to disqualify men categorically from the dicsussion, as the ability to become pregnant does not correspond with any given position on the issue.
</p>
<p>
    We can only do our best to balance all relevant considerations. Even with that effort, we do not imagine the resulting body of law will satisfy everyone, at all times, under all circumstances. The best we can hope for is to maximize the "good" and minimize the "bad," in accordance with Utilitarian Ethics. 
</p>
<p>
    While our solution is not perfect, we do not think a case can be made that the existing situation in the US is better than what we propose, nor do we see that the extreme polar positions on this issue that Americans express offer a balanced, practical approach. If anything, the history of discussions on the issue indicates Americans are incapable of reaching a consensus, and therefore they must have a solution imposed on them by law, so that this single issue does not absorb so much of Americans' energy and time. 
</p>
<p>
    An observation that came out in the discussion was that some women feel nothing for their unborn children, while others have a deep personal bond with them. The former would be happy that the law granted them the right to make the choice, while the latter might feel "judged" for ending a human life. In our view, this is a matter of individual differences. It is not the State's responsibility to manage everyone's individual feelings directly, or to craft laws in such a way as to make every decision "feel good." 
</p>
<p>
    The reality is that some decisions cannot feel good, and possibly <em>should not</em> feel good to anyone who has normal human emotions, because there are no "happy" alternatives on the table. Yet, people still must make a choice. The State wants to enable the maximum level of individual liberty for Americans to make difficult decisions without interference. We think our approach keeps the State out of people's way to the extent possible without abrogating its duty to protect human rights.
</p>
<p>
    To provide a broader context to the question of emotion, we can consider a situation other than pregnancy. The State prohibits the intentional taking of anyone's life. However, there is an exception for self-defense. Even so, an individual who had to take a life in self-defense would probably feel intense guilt. They might feel "judged" by others. They might suspect people at social gatherings were pointing toward them and whispering about them. They might even require counseling or therapy for some time after the incident. It is possible they would never entirely get over their feelings. We understand and respect that, but the intensity of emotion does not make the individual's feelings or perceived social stigma a matter for State law. 
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, if a woman must terminate a pregnancy for some reason - perhaps as a prerequisite to receiving cancer treatments, or as in the case reported here, because of child abuse and rape - she will experience intense emotions about the decision, and she may never fully recover from the emotional trauma. That is unfortunate, but is not a reason to change State law.
</p>
<p>
    The pregnant woman's feelings would certainly be one of the considerations she must weigh when faced with such a decision. The State cannot dictate what those feelings must be, nor protect her from her feelings, nor prevent other people from having opinions about it. In fact, one of the characteristics of a free society is that different individuals may make different choices when faced with similar problems. Other people are not required to approve of those choices; on the other hand, other people are not permitted to interfere with those choices.
</p>
<p>
    Social stigma, if any, is a matter of culture, not of law. The State cannot specify or enforce culture. Cultural views about abortion have changed considerably over the decades and centuries, and will continue to change. While we understand and respect this aspect of the question, direct protection against social stigma, for this reason or for any other, is out of scope for State law.
</p> 
<p>
    In summary, in this unusual and heartbreaking case, the laws of the State would have enabled the girl to obtain the necessary procedure without the additional stress of nationwide publicity and the need to travel. She was able to obtain the procedure after all, but the oppressive laws of Ohio generated considerable stress and trauma that were entirely unnecessary.
