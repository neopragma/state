This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Changes To the Legal Code, May 2024</h1>

<p>
    10 May 2024
</p>

<p>
    The Legal Code of the American State is amended effective 10 May 2024 as follows.
</p>
<p>
    Statute 3.4.9 pertains to timely adjudication of court cases. Verbage was added to clarify that anyone charged with a Category 1 offense of any kind, and anyone charged with a Category 2 offense in which the financial value of the damage done exceeds $5,000, will receive a trial by jury. In all other cases, the accused may demand a trial by jury. Such demand cannot be refused. Otherwise, minor offenses will be adjudicated by a court (that is, by a judge). 
</p>
<p>
    Statute 4.4 was added. It pertains to employer compensation for employees while they perform the civic duties of (a) jury duty and (b) voting. The rationale for the statute is to correct the situation in the United States whereby many citizens are unable to fulfill these duties because they cannot afford the loss of income while they are serving on (or being considered for) a jury, or while they take time off from work to cast their vote. Under the State system, jury duty and voting are mandatory to maintain Full Citizenship. Therefore, citizens must have the <em>practical ability</em> to participate in these activities regardless of their financial circumstances. Failure to compensate employees while they serve on a jury or cast their votes is considered to threaten the sustainability of the system that provides Americans with individual liberty, and is therefore a Category 1 offense.
</p>
<p>
	Statute 19.3 was added. It pertains to early release of incarcerated individuals. The rationale is that incarceration as such is the punishment, and additional suffering is not justified. When there are special circumstances, anyone may petition a court to approve the early release of an inmate, and a judge may approve or disapprove the request. For example, if an inmate's spouse is diagnosed with a terminal illness and may die before the inmate completes their sentence, an early release may be approved at the discretion of a judge. As a hedge against abuse of this law, until the inmate's originally-scheduled release date, should they be convicted of another offense then the judge who approved the early release and all persons involved in the petition for early release, including attorneys, will share in responsibility for the harm done by the individual in that second offense. As of the originally-scheduled release date, the slate is cleared for everyone involved. The waiting period for reinstatement of Full Citizenship, if any, begins as of the actual release date, even if it is earlier than the originally-scheduled release date.  
</p>
<p>
	Statute 18.2 was added. It pertains to transparency in pricing for goods and services. Surcharges, taxes, gratuities, and any other additional charges for any goods or services must be included in the price shown to customers before the customer makes the decision to buy. "What you see is what you pay." This is modeled on the state of California's Senate Bill 478, Consumers Legal Remedies Act: advertisements (2023-2024), but is less comprehensive than the California bill.
