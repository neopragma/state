This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Changes To the Legal Code, May 2024</h1>

<p>
    10 May 2024
</p>

<p>
    The Legal Code of the American State is amended effective 10 May 2024 as follows.
</p>
<p>
    Statute 3.4.9 pertaining to timely adjudication of court cases. Verbage was added to clarify that anyone charged with a Category 1 offense of any kind, and anyone charged with a Category 2 offense in which the financial value of the damage done exceeds $5,000, will receive a trial by jury. In all other cases, the accused may demand a trial by jury. Such demand cannot be refused. Otherwise, minor offenses will be adjudicated by a court (that is, by a judge). 
</p>
<p>
    Statute 4.4 was added. It pertains to employer compensation for employees while they perform the civic duties of (a) jury duty and (b) voting. The rationale for the statute is to correct the situation in the United States whereby many citizens are unable to fulfill these duties because they cannot afford the loss of income while they are serving on (or being considered for) a jury, or while they take time off from work to cast their vote. Under the State system, jury duty and voting are mandatory to maintain Full Citizenship. Therefore, citizens must have the <em>practical ability</em> to participate in these activities regardless of their financial circumstances. Failure to compensate employees while they serve on a jury or cast their votes is considered to threaten the sustainability of the system that provides Americans with individual liberty, and is therefore a Category 1 offense.
