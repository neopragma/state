US Navy losses

Issue: $2.5 billion (60%) of DoD transfer authority was shifted to build the border wall under Pres. Trump.
The Navy has been short of funds for maintenance. The fleet may not be in optimal operating condition.

Frigates and destroyers cost between about $1.2 billion and $2 billion. 

Aircraft carriers coast about $12 to $13 billion.

War simulations to repel an invasion of Taiwan predict losses of 150 ships, but public reports do not specify which types.

Assuming the loss of 149 frigates and destroyers at an average cost of $1.6 billion, and 1 carrier at a cost of $12.5 billion,
that would mean just the equipment lost would represent a value of $14.1 billion. 

This does not consider training costs, maintenance costs, or operating costs. 

$14,100,000,000
