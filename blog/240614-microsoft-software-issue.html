This blog contains articles that relate topical news reports and current public discourse with the proposed political system for the American State. The goal is to explore how each situation might play out differently under the State system than it did under the existing US system.

<h1>Microsoft Software Security Issue</h1>

<p>
    14 June 2024
</p>

<p>
    The SolarWinds Orion data breach was carried out by Russian state-sponsored hackers to collect sensitive information from several United States government agencies. It has significant security implications for the country. Intrusions into government systems are ongoing as of the date of writing.
</p>
<p>
    The hack exploited vulnerabilities in software Microsoft had sold to the government with full knowledge that the vulnerability existed and an explicit business decision not to correct the software. Executives at Microsoft chose to cover up the vulnerability in order to win the lucrative government contract. 
</p>
<p>
    The incident is well-documented elsewhere, and we won't reiterate the details here. Our purpose is to speculate about how things might have happened differently had the American State been established at the time, as a way to explore differences between the existing system and the proposed one.
</p>
<p>
    Under the present-day US system, Microsoft Corporation and its decision-making executives face no negative consequences. The executives sold out the long-term security of the American people for a few extra dollars beyond their already-vast personal wealth. The rest of us will have to deal with whatever the Russians may mete out to us, today and years into the future.
</p>

<h3>How would this play out under the State system?</h3>

<p>
    Had the State system been established at the time, it is likely the problem would not have occurred. Executives at Microsoft and their legal advisors would be well aware of the legal implications of undermining the Three Pillars of Independence, and of the fact incorporation provides no legal shield for business decision-makers who cause harm. 
</p>
<p>
    Given the choice between addressing the software problem proactively or covering it up, they would almost certainly have understood the more prudent course was to address the problem. It is also likely they would still have won the government contract on the true merits of the software product, without any tricks or games or lies. 
</p>
<p>
    For the sake of exploring the differences between the two legal systems, if we assume the executives made the same choices when operating under the State system, then they would be charged with the Category 1 offense of undermining the Three Pillars of Independence. Given the backstory, it is highly likely they would be convicted. The consequences for each individual decision-maker would be based on their relative contribution to the harm caused. 
</p>
<p>
    This sort of offense calls for a prison term ranging from 5 to 30 years, according to the State's Legal Code. The impact of such a significant data breach by a hostile foreign power is far-reaching. For that reason, the offenders would probably receive sentences closer to the maximum term than the minimum. 
</p>
<p>
    The corporation itself would continue to operate with the convicted individuals replaced by others. As the company's work does affect the Three Pillars, it would be subject to regulatory oversight. There could be some sort of administrative procedure to verify the company had changed its policy appropriately. That would be handled at the regulatory level rather than the statutory level, and the details are not part of the basic policital model.
