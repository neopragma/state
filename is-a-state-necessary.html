<h1>Is a State necessary?</h1>

<p>
Do we need a State to ensure human needs, human rights, and legal rights are upheld, and that the Three Pillars of Independence are maintained? Can the people handle these things without a formal government?  
</p>
<p>
Food production and distribution to support a population in excess of 350 million people probably cannot be supported adequately by individual and small family farms and independent truckers. If some people had food while others did not, chaos would ensue. 
</p>
<p>
Reliable, large-scale agriculture is certainly a necessity, and a nationwide transportation infrastructure comprising multiple transportation technologies is needed to distribute food to all corners of the nation before it rots. 
</p>
<p>
Without regulation and law enforcement, such a system would devolve into conditions such as we see in certain undeveloped countries - local warlords and strong men stealing trucks and their contents and killing the drivers.
</p>
<p>
Energy generation and distribution is a different matter. The technology exists, and is financially within reach, for individuals and small-scale property owners to generate electricity at the point of use, or in small generating plants that serve a local area. The current model of a single gigantic power grid, easily crippled by mechanical failure, weather, geological phenomena, accidents, terrorism, or military attacks, is outmoded. A combination of remote, but smaller-scale generation and very small scale point-of-use generation is feasible. 
</p>
<p>
A formal government might be useful to establish norms and standards so that things fit together and operate together safely, and to prevent large corporations from taking over the energy sector.
</p>
<p>
While many survivalists and preppers believe they can defend their own homesteads from individuals trying to steal food, or from minor and occasional incursions by law enforcement or governmental agencies, the question of fending off the professional armed forces of a foreign nation-state is quite different. Holing up in your house with rifle in hand will have no effect against a group of attack helicopters armed with rockets, a long-range hypersonic missile, a satellite-based laser weapon, an NBC attack (nuclear, biological, chemical) or any of countless threats well beyond the capability of any individual to resist, or even to detect <em>en route</em>. 
</p>
<p>
Even a small squadron of real soldiers would make short work of a prepper's homestead, notwithstanding grassroots home-defense groups whose members include former military members. That sort of thing is not sufficient to defend the entire country even for a few minutes, nor to defend a homestead or redoubt against a determined attack by a well-supplied military force.
</p>
<p>
Without large-scale, well-coordinated defensive systems, logistical management, qualified strategy, and professional-grade training, the country would be an easy target for any foreign power; possibly even for a well-organized and well-funded non-governmental organization such as a drug cartel. 
</p>
<p>
Our conclusion is that a State is necessary to ensure human needs, human rights, and legal rights are upheld, and that the Three Pillars of Independence are maintained sustainably.
