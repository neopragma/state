<h1>Backgrounder on Law Enforcement</h1>

<p>
The transition from the present-day US system to the State system will affect profoundly the organization and operation of the law enforcement function of government. It will be challenging due to the wide range of changes, including (at least):
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>the explicit focus on human rights and legal rights in the new system, and the definition of those things as compared with the present system;</li>
		<li>the notion of "equality before the law" extended to include law enforcement personnel, who will be accountable to a greater degree than presently;</li>
		<li>the practical separation of duties, compared with the present system in which law enforcement agencies are responsible for much more than enforcing the law as such; and</li>
		<li>the change from a federation of states to a single national government.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>1. What is Law Enforcement?</h2>

<p>
It is difficult to understand how best to implement any given function of government unless we have a clear definition of that function. In this section, we want to arrive at a practical working definition of the term for purposes of the State.
</p>

<a name="definitions"/>
<h3>1.1. Self-Referential Definitions</h3>

<p>
When we looked for "official" definitions of the term, <em>law enforcement</em>, almost all the definitions we found were self-referential. That is, by definition, a problem of definition. Examples (emphasis ours):
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>"<strong>Law enforcement</strong> is the activity of some members of government who act in an organized manner to <strong>enforce the law</strong>..." (Wikipedia)</li>
		<li>"<strong>law enforcement</strong> is the department of people who <strong>enforce laws</strong>..." (Merriam-Webster)</li>
		<li>"<strong>law enforcement</strong>: the activity of making certain that the <strong>laws</strong> of an area <strong>are obeyed</strong>..." (Cambridge)</li>
		<li>"<strong>Law enforcement</strong> is the collective term for professionals who are dedicated to upholding and <strong>enforcing the laws</strong>..." (My Law Questions) <em>Note:</em> Lawyers add words without clarifying meaning.</li>
		<li>"<strong>law enforcement</strong>: ensuring <strong>obedience to the laws</strong>" (Free Dictionary)</li>
		<li>"<strong>Law enforcement</strong> describes the agencies and employees responsible for <strong>enforcing laws</strong>..." (United States Bureau of Justics Statistics)</li>
		<li>"<strong>law enforcement</strong> means activities carried out by <strong>law enforcement</strong> authorities..." (Law Insider)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
We were able to find a few clearer definitions of the term. Here is one:
</p>
<p>
"A law enforcement officer is a government employee who is responsible for the prevention, investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws..." (US Legal - uslegal.com)
</p>
<p>
While far better than most, this definition still leaves something to be desired. It defines an officer, and not specifically the term, <em>law enforcement</em>. It seems to us <em>law enforcement</em> could be carried out by other means besides an "officer." The definition presupposes a particular implementation of the law enforcement function, or a particular approach to that responsibility of government. 
</p>
<p>
The definition states, literally, that the "officer...is responsible for the prevention...of individuals." That describes an officer whose job is to distribute condoms. Surely, this cannot be what was intended. Still, we commend the effort to avoid using the term in its own definition. 
</p>

<a name="lackbetterword"/>
<h3>1.2. For Lack of a Better Word</h3>

<p>
The State will have a legal code. People who live within the State's jurisdiction will violate statutes in the legal code. A certain percentage of the population will routinely violate statutes as a way of life. That is the case in every society.
</p>
<p>
It is preferable for the society as a whole that people adhere to the legal code as a general rule, only making exceptions under unusual circumstances, and doing so mindfully and with good judgment. The vast majority of people will live in this way. They will not spend their days looking for opportunities to break the law. 
</p>
<p>
So, the purpose of law enforcement must be related to encouraging people's decision to follow the law in their day-to-day activities, and handling situations in which people choose differently in a way that maximizes the "good" and minimizes the "harm" to the society (per utilitarian ethics).
</p>
<p>
The definitions of "law enforcement" that we found all indicate a certain unspoken assumption: The only way people will follow the law is if they are <em>forced</em> to do so, against their will. The word "enforcement" itself contains the word, "force."  
</p>
<p>
Two of the examples we list above use the word "obey" or "obedience" instead of "enforcement." Obedience is a choice made by an individual, not something forced on them by an external agent. Yet, both those definitions turn it around by using the terms "ensuring" or "making certain" - that phrasing indicates an external agent must act, or the individual will not choose to live according to the law. 
</p>
<p>
There is an underlying assumption that most people are "bad" and cannot be trusted to behave properly unless an armed guard is standing over them. This assumption is evident in the fact most people think of "law enforcement" and "policing" as one and the same thing. We consider the two quite different.
</p>
<p>
When we considered alternatives to the word, "enforcement," we were unable to come up with a term that accurately conveys the intended meaning without suggesting "force," and yet does not introduce ambiguity of its own, or sound stilted and officious, like "Statutory Compliance Assurance." We decided to stick with the familiar term, "law enforcement," and define it in a way that fits with the underlying philosophy of the State. 
</p>


<a name="statedefinition"/>
<h3>1.3. The State's Definition of "Law Enforcement"</h3>

<p class="excerpt">
The law enforcement function of the government comprises all official activities of the State and its designated representatives aimed at encouraging people to behave in accordance with the basic philosophy of individual liberty, particularly with respect to human rights, legal rights, and the Three Pillars of Independence, and to respond to cases in which harm is done by compensating the victim(s) to the extent practical and by bringing those who caused the harm to justice. 
</p>
<p>
Related philosophical points in the State model include:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Government with a light touch - laws are to be enforced with minimal intrusion into normal life; and</li>
		<li>The <em>effect</em> of an action is more important than how closely the action complies with statutory law; when no harm has been done, no offense has been committed. The purpose of the State is not to be a rigid bureaucracy devoid of humanity; it is to be a place where Americans can live in freedom.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Other functions of government with a role to play in this:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The public education curriculum; and</li>
		<li>Educational standards to be met by private schools and home schoolers.</li>
	</ul>
</p>



<h2>2. The Problem with Policing</h2>

<p>
We mentioned previously that most people conflate the ideas of <em>law enforcement</em> and <em>policing</em>, and that we consider the two quite different activities. Why do we say so, and what do we think "policing" means, if it is not an aspect of law enforcement?
</p>

<a name="policemeaning"/>
<h3>2.1. Meanings of the Word, "Police"</h3>

<p>
Merriam-Webster defines the verb, <em>to police</em>, as follows: 
</p>
<p>
	1 archaic: govern<br/>
	2 : to control, regulate, or keep in order by use of police<br/>
	3 : to make clean and put in order<br/> 
	4 a : to supervise the operation, execution, or administration to prevent or detect and prosecute violations of rules and regulations<br/>
	4 b : to exercise such supervision over the policies and activities of<br/>
	5 : to perform the functions of a police force in or over
</p>
<p>
Meanings 2, 4, and 5 reinforce the ideas that (a) policing and law enforcement are the same thing, and (b) a heavy-handed and authoritatian approach to law enforcement is necessary or preferred, because people will tend to be unruly and misbehave unless they are monitored at all times and threatened with violence.
</p>
<p>
Meaning 3 resonates with us. The idea of a "police force" (there's the word "force" again) patrolling the streets, looking for trouble, is similar to the idea of "policing the area," as an Army sergeant might order Privates to do to keep them busy. The Privates will look for trash, broken items, damage to buildings or vehicles, paint in need of refreshing, people who do not look as if they belong on base, and anything else that is out of order. 
</p>
<p>
That is exactly what police officers do when they patrol the streets of a city. They are looking for trouble. They assume anyone they see is probably "up to something," and they can find out what it is if they observe or possibly harass the individual.
</p>
<p>
When police officers on patrol do not notice any trouble for hours on end, they become bored. At that point, they <em>make</em> trouble. This is a huge problem in the present-day US. Americans do not need that sort of problem. Most Americans are not "up to" anything beyond minding their own business. If they require the assistance of law enforcement officers, they will call.
</p> 

<a name="ushistory/">
<h3>2.2. Policing and Law Enforcement in US History</h3>

<p>
The present organization and behavior of police in the US is a result of historical developments. There is no need to reiterate the entire history here, as there are plenty of published sources. In any case, this history partially explains some of the behavior we see in police officers today.
</p>
<p>
Cities and towns usually have a "police department," while rural areas have a "sheriff" operating at the county level. The "sheriff" model evolved from the original slave patrols of the slave states in the early US. These were civilian militiamen who were conscripted into service to hunt down runaways and return them to their "owners." 
</p>
<p>
The "police" model evolved from two sources. First, as cities grew in population and density and deep poverty gripped the US in the 19th century, more and more people resorted to petty crime to survive. Residents organized grassroots "watch" groups, similar to neighborhood patrols of the present era. 
</p>
<p>
Second, with industrialization and immigration, industrialists and politicians wanted to control the movements of "undesirables" - their own employees - so they would not move about in the "wrong" neighborhoods after work hours. This also became the standard approach to labor disputes. They employed public police departments and private agencies, notably the Pinkerton detective agency, to control these people. These organizations eventually evolved into modern police departments.
</p>
<p>
Today, sheriff and police departments both operate in the same way. The differences are in terminology and the level of government that employs each type of organization. When we write "police" hereafter, we mean to include sheriff departments as well. 
</p>
<p>
Police in the US respond to all kinds of calls. Some of these are truly dangerous, involving armed suspects and often pertaining to crimes in progress. They are trained primarily to deal with this type of call. However, police departments are also called for other kinds of issues - a person acting strangely in public, a street person sleeping in a park, a domestic disturbance, a group of teens having a loud party, or a white person falsely reporting one or more black people "behaving in a threatening manner" (i.e, "being black in public"). 
</p>
<p>
Due to their training, police almost always arrive on the scene with guns already drawn or, at least, with their hands already on their weapons, ready to draw. In one incident that was videoed and posted to YouTube, a group of officers calmly approached a street person sitting at a bus stop and shot him to death with military-style rifles, then walked away chatting as if nothing unusual had happened. 
</p>
<p>
There have been countless incidents such as police killing a driver they had stopped for a minor traffic violation, a child at play outside his home, a person who had been arguing with their spouse in their own home, a mentally-ill person who was lost and confused, and so forth. 
</p>

<a name="stateconcept/">
<h3>2.3. The State's Conception of "Policing"</h3>
<p>
In our view, Americans do not need to be policed, in the sense of policing an area to look for trash. Americans are not trash. 
</p>
<p>
However, some of the functions currently carried out by police departments are necessary law enforcement activities. The State will organize law enforcement agencies to handle the kinds of activities that "should" be handled by armed officers who are trained for violence. However, these agencies will not handle every type of call that present-day US police departments handle. 
</p>
<p>
For situations that rarely, if ever, call for an armed response in which the default action is to kill people, the State will organize different types of agencies. Some of these may require the assistance of armed officers, depending on what they find when they arrive on the scene. This reality requires cooperation between the armed-and-violent agencies and the help-people-with-everyday-problems agencies. 
</p>

<a name="functions"/>
<h2>3. Law Enforcement Functions</h2>

<p>
The fact the State will not have "police departments" in the same sense as the present-day US does not mean police officers must worry for their jobs under the new system. There is plenty of law enforcement work to be done. Some of it will give officers the opportunity to use their weapons. We simply prefer they not use their weapons against innocent people.
</p>

<a name="funcinvestigation"/>
<h3>3.1. Investigation of Crimes</h3>

<p>
When people see activity they believe might be illegal, they normally notify law enforcement agencies. This includes all kinds of crimes as well as activities that an observer mistook for a crime. It includes street crimes like burglary, white-collar crimes like embezzlement, and organized crime like human trafficking or drug trafficking. 
</p>
<p>
The primary function of law enforcement in the State is to investigate reported suspected crimes, first to determine whether the reported activity actually looks like a crime, and if so, then to deal with the situation appropriately. 
</p>

<a name="funccompliance"/>
<h3>3.2. Regulatory Compliance Oversight</h3>

<p>
Apart from violations of statutory law, the State's responsibility to enforce the law includes oversight of regulations. This may include scheduled and routine audits, surprise visits to companies, and investigations launched in response to reports of violations.
</p>
<p>
This function will require specialized expertise in many different areas. Verifying compliance by a steel plant is very different from verifying compliance by a hospital, which is very different from verifying compliance in the construction industry or at a nuclear energy facility. Law enforcement agencies may hire their own experts or use private-sector contractors to support this work.
</p>

<a name="funcprosecution"/>

<h3>3.3. Arrest and Prosecution of Suspected Offenders</h3>

<p>
The process of making an arrest can be very different depending on the nature of the offense and the suspect. Some arrests occur in the heat of the moment while officers are responding to an emergency call. Others involve arresting a suspect who does not want to cooperate and who may be armed and violent. Arrests for white-collar crimes usually occur in an office building or at the suspect's home, and are not dangerous. Law enforcement personnel must be trained and ready for many different arrest scenarios. 
</p>
<p>
Following an arrest, a suspect may have to be held in a minimum-security facility for a short time to await trial or, if it is determined that the wrong person has been arrested, release. Law enforcement agencies must be equipped to handle this, as well as transportation to and from trial, and transportation from court to prison.
</p>
<p>
The prosecution of the case is also a law enforcement function. In the present US system, this is normally a responsibility of a District Attorney. A job function similar to this must exist under the State system, as well; it will probably have the same job title and general duties. Because of the different governmental structure of the State, the District Attorney position will not be a political stepping-stone; it will just be a job. We hope this will minimize cases of District Attorneys knowingly pushing for a high-profile conviction when they know the accused is not guilty.
</p>

<a name="funcincarceration"/>
<h3>3.4. Incarceration of Convicted Offenders</h3>

<p>
The operation of prison facilities is another function of law enforcement. This requires facilities management and security expertise as well as medical, psychological, food preparation and nutrition, laundry, and rehabilitation and recreational facilities expertise. 
</p>
<p>
In our view, most activities are handled most efficiently by the private sector, and only a few activities are best handled by the government. We believe prison management is best handled directly by government agencies, and should not be farmed out to private firms. History shows that farming out this responsibility results in abuses of human rights and legal rights as well as increased operating costs and high recidivism. It also tends to exacerbate the problem of excessive incarceration rates in the US.
</p>

<a name="funcemergency"/>
<h3>3.5. Emergency Response</h3>

<p>
An emergency is an unplanned situation that arises unexpectedly ("emerges") and creates danger to the public. Emergencies run the gamut from natural events such as floods and tornadoes to accidental events such as building fires and chemical spills to intentional acts such as terrorist attacks and hostage-taking. 
</p>
<p>
This function of law enforcement is similar to police and SWAT response teams in the present-day US, as well as police support for other first responders such as fire departments and emergency medical services. 
</p>

<a name="funcproactive"/>
<h3>3.6. Proactive Operations</h3>

<p>
Proactive operations are planned law enforcement actions resulting from investigations that uncover ongoing (and often organized) criminal activity such as drug production and trafficking, human trafficking, terrorism, and so forth. These operations may aim to arrest an individual or to halt and capture participants in large-scale criminal enterprises involving coordinated actions at multiple locations. 
</p>

<a name="funcsupport"/>
<h3>3.7. Support for Social Services</h3>

<p>
Under the State system, armed officers trained for violence will not be the first responders to calls such as domestic arguments, loud children's parties, confused people wandering in the street, homeless people sleeping in a park, and similar matters. However, there are times when the social services personnel who respond to these calls encounter a dangerous situation that calls for support from an armed officer. Law enforcement will play this role in the new system.
</p>

<a name="funcprotection"/>
<h3>3.8. Protection for Public Figures Under Threat</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, there are times when a public figure is under threat by a domestic or foreign actor. The responsibility of the State for law enforcement will include such situations.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> As this was written, the news of the day included the murder of a judge by a man he had sent to prison years before, and a plot to murder a US Supreme Court Justice that was thwarted by the FBI (in an example of a proactive operation). 
</p>

<a name="services"/>
<h2>4. Social Services Operated in Collaboration with Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>
Not every call for help is best handled by armed officers primed for violence. In the State system, the first responders to situations that do not obviously pose any danger will be social services personnel trained to handle them. Still, there will be occasions when a situation that at first seems benign turns dangerous. Law enforcement personnel must be ready to support social services specialists when needed.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> As this is written, there is a movement in the US known as "defund the police." It is usually misunderstood to mean slashing police department budgets without making any other changes. What it really means is that armed police officers are not the most appropriate people to respond to certain calls for help, and that not every activity currently managed through police departments should be (such as youth sports programs). 
</p>

<a name="servdomestic"/>
<h3>4.1. Domestic Disturbance Response</h3>

<p>
All too often, when a couple gets into a fight someone calls the police and someone is killed. Under the State system, social services workers will respond to domestic disturbance calls. Only if they, in turn, request support will armed officers be dispatched.
</p>


<a name="servunusual"/>
<h3>4.2. Unusual Behavior Response</h3>

<p>
All too often, someone with mental illness or dementia or someone who is drunk or high is killed by armed police officers. Someone observes the individual acting strangely (wandering aimlessly, talking to themselves) or thinks they do not belong where they are (such as a park or an upscale neighborhood) and they call the police. Armed officers arrive and kill the person on the spot. They may scream unintelligibly at him to lie down, and when he does not comply within seconds, they open fire; or they may simply open fire immediately on arrival. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, social services workers will respond to suspicious behavior calls. Only if they, in turn, request support will armed officers be dispatched.
</p>


<a name="servyouth"/>
<h3>4.3. Youth Programs</h3>

<p>
Youth programs and various community outreach programs are not really law enforcement functions. It seems quite odd to associate such things with law enforcement. Under the State system, these activities will be managed through social services agencies rather than law enforcement agencies.
</p>


<a name="servparole"/>
<h3>4.4. Parole Programs</h3>

<p>
When a convicted criminal is released on parole, they must check in with a parole officer periodically. In the US, this is handled by police officers. Under the State system, this will be a social services function. Parole is likely to be more successful if the offender feels they are under the guidance of someone other than the same organization that arrested and convicted them.
</p>

<a name="organization"/>
<h2>5. Organizational Implications of the Single-State System</h2>

<p>
The organization of law enforcement and police in the US grew from the ground up, and most law enforcement work is organized and managed at the local level. Federal law enforcement agencies usually focus on large-scale organized crime, corruption, terrorism, and series crimes such as murder and kidnapping that cross state borders. States also have their own investigative bureaus. 
</p>
<p>
These various agencies and bureaus are largely independent of one another and cooperate on a volunteer basis and on request. This decentralization can make local law enforcement more effective for their respective locales, but also makes it relatively easy for criminals to escape justice simply by changing jurisdictions. Lacking infinite resources, police departments drop cases they cannot solve in a fairly short time. Similarly, it is possible for an officer with a track record of misbehavior or violence to continue working in the law enforcement field by applying for work in a different city. The killer of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2014 did just that, and continues working as a police officer to this day.
</p>
<p>
Professional standards, oversight, and discipline within the law enforcement community is handled mainly by police benevolent associations and police labor unions. There is no single, nationwide set of standards or oversight group.
</p>
<p>
Given a single national government and no states, it is possible to organize law enforcement agencies in a single hierarchy. This enables locally-focused law enforcement to continue as before while providing the advantage of near-instantaneous communication and sharing of information about investigations, as well as more consistent professional standards and oversight for law enforcement personnel.
</p>

<a name="transition"/>
<h2>6. Considerations for the Transition Plan</h2>

<p>
The Transition Plan for law enforcement will be among the most challenging to devise. The shift from a federation of states to a single government, and the realignment of law enforcement resources and organizations hierarchically instead of as a collection of independent local agencies and departments will require close attention in order to maintain order, service, and public safety through the transitional period. 
</p>
<p>Besides that, the change in many positions of leadership from elected posts to positions in a hierarchy will be difficult. Many well-qualified people currently in roles such as Chief of Police or Sheriff may choose to leave the law enforcement field rather than submit to that kind of career change. City mayors may balk at the loss of oversight of "their" police departments. 
</p>


<a name="transtate"/>
<h3>6.1. Responsibilities Currently at the US State Level</h3>

<p>
In the present-day US system, state police departments handle investigations and support local departments in matters that cross county lines within their state, in much the same way as the FBI supports investigations that cross state lines. In addition, the state police are usually the organization that monitors traffic on state and Interstate highways, as those roadways cross county lines. They also assist with emergency response as needed.
</p>
<p>
The need for these activities will not change under the State system, but the organization of personnel will be under a single law enforcement hierarchy. In some ways, this will simplify and improve law enforcement service. Traffic management on any roadway can be handled by any officer, and any officer can pursue a suspect who crosses into an area that used to be in a different state. When additional support is needed in a small town, officers from anywhere can be assigned. 
</p>

<a name="trancomm"/>
<h3>6.2. Vertical Lines of Communication Through Governmental Structure</h3>

<p>
In the present-day US system, the logistics of communication and collaboration are challenging, both horizontally across independent local departments and vertically between local departments and state and federal agencies. Under the State system, lines of communication will have to be established throughout the hierarchy of law enforcement agencies. 
</p>


<a name="transafe"/>
<h3>6.3. Public Safety During the Transition</h3>

<p>
Those of a mind to commit crimes will take advantage of the confusion about the roles law enforcement personnel are supposed to play and who is responsible for what, as well as the disruption caused by the fundamental change in overall structure and the conversion of certain important elected posts into "regular jobs," along with the resistance many law enforcement professionals will have to the changes. They will use passive resistance heavily to try and force the State to retain the old system and/or to "prove" the State's approach is untenable. This will open the door for a lot of mischief.
</p>
<p>
There will be great risk to public safety owing to these factors. The transition plan, and its practical execution, will have to be very attentive to these issues. The change will not be smooth.
