<h1>What is human?</h1>

<p>
To be explicit about when human rights apply, and to clarify our responsibilities toward others to ensure their rights are treated equally with our own, we want to offer a definition of "human." This definition of "human" is not intended to be all-encompassing; it is limited to the context of human rights as a foundation for the State. 
</p>
<p>
Within that context, the State considers the matter closed to public debate and protest. This is necessary due to the long-lasting, never-ending, unresolvable, hateful, and deeply damaging debate about the subject of abortion rights in the US. 
</p>
<p>
Unambiguously, a human is fully human from the moment of birth to the moment of death. However, for purposes of human rights it is sensible to extend the time frame.
</p>

<h3>1. Humanity before birth</h3>

<p>
Between the moment of conception and the moment of birth, living tissue within a woman's body develops gradually into a young human. There is no consensus regarding the time when the developing tissue changes its status from "lump of tissue" to "baby." 
</p>
<p>
People have used various <em>ad hoc</em>, subjective criteria to define that change in status. Some have defined a period of time - usually, the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy - as the moment when the tissue becomes human. Others have noted that developing fetuses can feel pain at a certain stage of development, and they say this indicates the fetus is a baby. Still others have looked for a heartbeat, and declared that is the defining moment. Finally, religious believers claim that whatever happens with regard to pregnancy is God's will and cannot be subverted by Man's intervention. 
</p>

<h4>1.1. Time-based definition</h4>

<p>
As medical science has advanced, it has become possible to extract a developing fetus at earlier times during pregnancy, and have it complete its development outside the womb. This seems to push time-based definitions back toward the moment of conception. We cannot anticipate how far back science might be able to push back the time when the developing fetus can be kept viable outside the womb. 
</p>
<p>
As this is written, it seems perfectly feasible to generate a living human by cloning. In that case, no womb would be involved at all, even at the earliest stages of development. 
</p>
<p>
Because a time-based definition of humanity is ambiguous and subject to change, we resist using a time-based criterion to define "human."
</p>

<h4>1.2. Response-based definition</h4>

<p>
Many studies have been conducted that demonstrate developing fetuses can respond to external stimuli. It is not the purpose of this document to serve as a bibliography; if we can find the references, so can you. Suffice it to say there is no debate that fetuses can respond to stimuli such as sound, light, and touch, at certain stages of development, depending on their general health. 
</p>
<p>
Yet, many forms of organic matter appear to "respond" when touched, exposed to light, or exposed to sound. Can it be said they are "feeling" anything, or they are aware of anything that is happening? This has not been established. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is possible the apparent reaction to an external stimulus may yield a false positive. It seems equally likely, absent further study, that the <em>lack</em> of an apparent response cannot be taken to mean the tissue is <em>not</em> human. Checking for a response is an unreliable method.
</p>
<p>
Due to this uncertainty, we resist using a response-based criterion to define "human."
</p>

<h4>1.3. Development-based definition</h4>

<p>
A popular idea at the time of writing is that the presence of a heartbeat is the indicator that the fetus has reached a stage of development when it must be considered human. While this is sensible on its face, it raises another question: If the fetus is human at 8:04 a.m., when its heart started to beat, then what was it at 8:03 a.m.? If we waited just one more minute, we would have a full-fledged human rather than a lump of tissue. Isn't that a "technicality?" If as of 8:03 a.m. it is just about to become human, then what about 8:02 a.m., or 7:45 a.m., or yesterday? Development-based criteria appear to have the same challenges as time-based criteria.
</p>
<p>
Due to the ambiguity, we resist using a development-based criterion to define "human."
</p>

<h4>1.4. Religion-based definition</h4>

<p>
Many adherents to religions, especially extreme ones, insist that whatever happens with regard to pregnancy is a matter of God's will. They hold that God's will supersedes everything else, even if the outcomes are harmful to humans. 
</p>
<p>
Proponents of this view often give contrived examples of bad behavior to justify the blanket prohibition of abortion: Promiscuous women who have abortion after abortion with no more thought than taking an aspirin for a headache, even in the latter stages of pregnancy. This is, of course, not a realistic scenario.
</p>
<p>
A more-realistic example would involve mainstream people living mainstream lives. For instance, a family with a traditional father and mother and three children, who want to have a fourth child. There are problems with the pregnancy, such that they must choose between losing the new baby or losing both the new baby and the mother. 
</p>
<p>
Religious advocates would prefer that both people die, leaving a widower and three motherless children behind. People who care about human rights would prefer that the family have an opportunity to try for a fourth child again, under better conditions. The reality is that some circumstances do not offer a "happy" choice. Here, we have a choice between one death or two. 
</p>
<p>
Apart from US-centric abortion rights arguments, religions have routinely, if not gleefully, trampled human rights far more often than they have upheld them. Throughout history, religion has been used as the justification for conquest, genocide, rape, bondage, and systematic oppression. 
</p>
<p>
We do not consider religious people to have much credibility when it comes to defining or defending human rights. Humans are simply not their main concern. But humans <em>are</em> the State's main concern.
</p>
<p>
For those reasons, we resist using religion to define "human."
</p>

<h4>1.5. Teleological definition</h4>

<p>
Where does that leave us? It does not leave us with an unambiguous definition of "human." We must accept some uncertainty and do our best to err on the side of human rights. 
</p>
<p>
The ancient Greek concept of <em>telos</em> is relevant here. A simplistic definition: Any given thing will develop into another specific thing if left to develop without interference. For instance, an acorn will develop into an oak tree.
</p>
<p>
This is different from <em>fate</em> or <em>destiny</em>. If it were the acorn's <em>fate</em> to become an oak tree, then it would become an oak tree no matter what happened. But an acorn can be crushed, dried up, burned up, or eaten. Then it will not become an oak tree.
</p>
<p>
The point is that an acorn can never become a fire hydrant, a cheese sandwich, or the planet Saturn. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, many - maybe most - pregnancies do not run to term. All sorts of problems can ensue. In many cases, the woman never knows she was pregnant - the pregnancy doesn't take hold. But if the pregnancy is healthy, the fetus can only become one thing: A human. It cannot become a fire hydrant, a cheese sandwich, or the planet Saturn. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the State extends human rights to humans from the point of conception. 
</p>
<p>
How is this different from religious extremists? Religious extremists have called for women who miscarry to be charged with murder. Religious extremists have demanded that abortion be prohibited regardless of health concerns. Religious extremists want the rights of the unborn to trump the rights of the "born" - they want to kill grown-up humans who disagree with them. 
</p>
<p>
The State does not penalize humans for being human, or for being subject to the laws of Nature. That means fetuses have human rights, defended on their behalf by the State, but those rights <em>do not</em> supersede the rights of any <em>other</em> humans, including the mother and other individuals involved with the situation. Every human's rights are of equal weight.
</p>
<p>
The State recognizes that reality often presents us with unpleasant choices, and that those choices are not made any easier when the government or other organizations intrude into personal or family matters.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the State imposes no restrictions on a woman's right to choose. We <em>do</em> ask that people understand and acknowledge what they are doing when they abort a pregnancy, and not trivialize or deny the basic humanity of the unborn child. 
</p>
<p>
In any case, let there be no fear that the State would charge a woman with murder simply because she miscarries.
</p>

<h3>2. Humanity after physical death</h3>

<p>
In our culture, when a person dies they are not simply pushed off the side of the road and immediately forgotten. Their lives have impact on others even after physical death. 
</p>
<p>
Eventually, these effects pass. After all, people have lived and died on this planet for many thousands of years, and we remember very few of them by name. But in the immediate aftermath of a death, others are still affected by the person's life - family, friends, businesses, community organizations, creditors, tenants...even pets. Business transactions that were set in motion prior to death may not have been completed. 
</p>
<p>
The final defense of human rights for a person recently passed is that the loose ends of their life are tied up with respect for them and those close to them. 
</p>
<p>
Often, when a person dies their relatives and others close to them descend upon their property like locusts, taking whatever they can. This is an insult to the person's life and memory.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the State requires that the final dispensation of a dead person's goods, property, and associations be handled with due respect for their human rights.
