	The Korean Conflict began in 1950 and a cease-fire was reached in 1953. The cease-fire has been in effect since then. The conflict has never formally ended. Korea remains a flash point for military escalation. As such, the situation is destabilizing for the Pacific region. North Korea repeatedly threatens South Korea, Japan, and the US, leading to multinational war games involving supporters of the North on the one hand and supporters of the South on the other. Any regional dispute, such as the status of Taiwan, can easily escalate beyond the level that is strictly necessary, should North Korea take the opportunity to strike while tensions are high. 
</p>
<p>
	The conflict began as a proxy war between the US and USSR during their 20th-century Cold War. The Cold War ended before most of the present population of the world was born; few people today remember it and still fewer care about it. With the advent of the State, and the establishment of modern Russia after 1989, neither the US nor the USSR - the original antagonists in the conflict - still exists. It is illogical for hostilities between North and South Korea to continue.
</p>
<p>
	Although the division of Korea was precipitated by outside actors and was not a choice of the Korean people, the two parts have operated separately for such a long time that reconciliation and reunification seem very unlikely. The two Koreas have taken different paths in their development. As this is written, they are so utterly different on a cultural level that it seems more feasible to keep them as two distinct countries. 
</p>
<p>
	However, the hostilities and the militarization of the 38th parallel can be brought to an end through diplomatic effort. The fact Korea has divided into two Koreas does not necessitate a hostile relationship. The people of Korea may need support from friends to reach that conclusion.
