<h1>Backgrounder on the Purpose of the State</h1>

<p>
We reiterate the statement of purpose at the top of every page in this collection of documents. How did we arrive at that statement? We reasoned through a few fundamental questions.
</p>

<h2>1. Who is the country for? Who lives here, and what do they expect from life?</h2>

<p>
America is for Americans. Under separate cover, we have explored the nature of Americans, their needs, their concept of individual liberty, what they expect a government to do for them and what they prefer the government not get involved with; conversely, what duties or obligations must a person fulfill toward others in order to ensure their <em>own</em> individual liberty is respected and defended, and that it is sustainable. 
</p>
<p>
Given the needs, values, beliefs, preferences, and self-concept of Americans, as well as the prevailing conditions of the world around them, how can they best achieve the goal to "establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty without external interference?"
</p>

<h2>2. Is a "State" or "Government" Necessary to Achieve the Goal?</h2>

<p>
Humans are social creatures by nature. In ancient times, a human alone was nothing but a quick snack for a sabre-toothed cat or cave bear. The only reason we are here today is that our ancestors learned to cooperate. The earliest "government" may have been the strongest member of a hunter-gatherer group, and the purpose of that "government" may have been simply to increase the chances of survival for the group. 
</p>
<p>
As human groups grew larger, our ancestors could no longer rely on an individual to ensure the survival of the group. Climate 
change may have triggered the agricultural revolution some 10,000 years ago, as people could no longer find enough food just by foraging. Larger groups, cooperating in more complicated ways, were needed. With those changes, more-complicated forms of government emerged.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forwarding to the present, everyone on the planet lives under the "rule" of some form of government. But many Americans believe (or speak as if they believe) it is possible for an individual to live without any dependency on others, and without giving any consideration to others. If this is true, then do Americans need a government at all? Is the State necessary?
</p>
<p>
Individualistic Americans are not the first to question the necessity of a "state." John Locke's work, and particularly his second treatise on government (1690), was well known to the authors of the founding documents of the United States, notably James Monroe and Thomas Jefferson. 
</p>
<p>
In Chapter II, sections 6 and 7, Locke describes a state of "liberty" but not of "license," in which people "may be restrained from invading others rights, and from doing hurt to one another." This concept is central to the Constitution and Legal Code of the State. It is a somewhat archaic and verbose formulation of the idea we call Kindergarten Wisdom - each person's rights end where the next person's rights begin.
</p>
<p>
It also expresses an idea we call the <em>appropriate balance between individual liberty and civic responsibility.</em> Another word for civic responsibility is "duty." Many Americans today recoil at the suggestion they have a "duty" to one another, and yet there is no way to maintain individual liberty on a sustainable basis unless members of the society perceive and honor their duty to one another.
</p>
<p>
Coming at the question from a different philosophical angle, Communist philosopher Friedrich Engels attempted to understand how a state takes form. In his 1884 essay, "The Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State," Engels characterizes the state as an outgrowth or side-effect of a society that has not yet reached full maturity. 
</p>
<p>
What did he mean by maturity? Communism posits a linear historical progression that Communists consider inevitable. Human societies pass through certain stages in a predictable sequence, ultimately settling into a steady-state existence in which everyone helps everyone else, and no government is necessary. 
</p>
<p>
The communistic vision does not seem realistic to us, and indeed we have found no historical example of it. The idea that history evolves linearly is also contrary to our observations. 
</p>
<p>
Yet, one can cite examples of groups of people living in a collaborative way, with no money, no "jobs" as such, and no privately-held real property. The examples we know of include:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Kibbutzim in Israel, starting with Degania in 1909 and continuing to the present day.</li>
		<li>Communes in the US, corresponding with the hippie movement of the 1960s and fizzling out along with that movement.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Another example that is slightly different in that it supports private property ownership is the American Redoubt, a region encompassing territory in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming where conservative Christians can establish a homestead and live according to the shared values of that community. 
</p>
<p>
In our view, three critical success factors have enabled these communities to thrive:
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Small size</li>
		<li>Shared values</li>
		<li>No physical threats from neighboring areas</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
Can the same model apply to a country the size of a continent with a population of 330 million people with diverse backgrounds? It seems unlikely, as none of the three enabling factors is present. 
</p>

<h3>2.1. Small Size</h3>

<p>
Human groups can be cohesive and self-managing up to a size of about 150 people. Larger groups enable <em>anonymity</em> - everyone doesn't know everyone else personally. It's easy to exploit or harm people you don't know - it is almost as if they are not real. 
</p>
<p>
A similar effect is observed in companies when they grow beyond about 150 to 200 employees. They need more formal structures and standard procedures than they did when they were small enough that everyone knew everyone else.
</p>
<p>
When the agricultural revolution occurred, thousands of people were needed to plant, harvest, transport, and store grain. This required more complicated organizational structures and more rigorous command hierarchies than previous ways of life. 
</p>
<p>
The <em>kibbutz</em> and the hippie commune generally have (or had) small populations. It was feasible for everyone to know everyone else, and to develop emotional connections. This helped enable a way of life that did not require a formal government as such.
</p>
<p>
The American Redoubt includes more than 150 people, but their shared values are centered on individualism, so they do not live in a collaborative way. Nothing changes significantly when they pass the 150-member threshhold. Given their extreme individualism, it is questionable that this group can be considered a "society" at all. 
</p>
<p>
The American Redoubt can exist today within the bubble of order and safety provided by the same government they despise. If and when the societal/governmental collapse they fear comes to pass, will this group remain cohesive or functional? 
</p>

<h3>2.2. Shared Values</h3>

<p>
The members of a <em>kibbutz</em>, the members of a hippie commune, and the people who move to the northwestern US to live in the American Redoubt all have something in common (within each group) - they share a basic set of values and beliefs. 
</p>
<p>
In a population as large and diverse as that of America, it is unlikely all the people would arrive at a shared set of values. Lacking that, the society would not automatically function peacefully and smoothly with everyone's best interests in mind. Before long, individuals who had different values would interfere with one another's rights in order to maximize their own "freedom."
</p>

<h3>2.3. No External Physical Threats</h3>

<p>
A kibbutz is not the government of Israel. The only reason a kibbutz can survive is that it is embedded within Israel, which ensures its security. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, a hippie commune and the American Redoubt need not defend themselves from foreign aggressors. Although both disparage the US government and see it as a kind of "enemy," they are/were protected from interference by foreign powers by the US military and by US law. 
</p>
<p>
Neither of these organizations could survive if they had to defend themselves directly from foreign aggression, without a formal government in place.
</p>
<p>
It does not seem feasible to achieve the goal of ensuring the maximum practical degree of individual liberty for all Americans on a sustainable basis without a government - a State. The country contains more than 150 people, they do not share a single set of values, and the country is beset with external threats to its freedom and even to its existence. So, the answer to this question is "Yes," a State is necessary.
</p>

<h2>3. What Role Should the State Play?</h2>
<p>
As the idea of the State is to enable Americans to live as they please without external interference for an indefinite time, it is clear the State should serve just that purpose. In keeping with general American values, the State should not <em>give</em> everything to the people. Instead, it shoud <em>establish and sustain conditions</em> under which Americans can take care of their own needs. When an American needs help on a temporary basis, the State can step in. The only laws should be those that protect people from others who believe their own rights include trampling on other people's rights, and those that ensure the <em>sustainability of the system</em> that enables individual liberty.
