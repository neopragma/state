<h2>1. Overview</h2>


<a name="oveffects"/>
<h3>1.1. Effects of Foreign Dependencies on Our Freedom</h3>
<p>
When one country holds sway over another, through economic hegemony, military threat, or control of a key need such as food, energy, or defense, it is not possible for the government, companies, or individuals in the second country to make decisions freely according to their own values and goals. They must comply with anything the first country demands of them, even when doing so causes them to suffer materially, physically, or emotionally, and to act contrary to their own deeply-held values. In some cases, the second country may be forced to act in a way contrary to its own long-term interests, in order to avoid short-term pain. 
</p>
<p>
To be truly free, we must establish the conditions in our own country that enable us to speak and act in accordance with our own values, without bending to the will of any foreign power. 
</p>
<p>
This is the reason for our firmness regarding the Three Pillars of Independence. The pillars are the sturdy framework that enables the State to uphold individual liberty on a sustainable basis. Such liberty cannot extend to the point that it tears down this framework; otherwise, liberty itself will be subverted. No one's personal freedom in the short term trumps everyone else's freedom in the long term.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, a company that takes the position of "company over country" may be prosecuted, and an individual who enables foreign interests to gain influence in our country as a way to gain personal wealth may be prosecuted. These prosecutions will be harsher than those for ordinary crimes, because they are not ordinary crimes; they are an existential threat to the country.  
</p>

<a name="ovfood"/>
<h3>1.2. Independence in Food Production, Quality, and Distribution</h3>

<p>
If our country depends on external sources of food, or food cannot be distributed to those who need it, then those who control the food can dictate that our people conform to their values, deliver whatever they demand, and support their actions, whatever they may be. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, our people can only be free if they can produce and distribute their own food. In addition, the food must be safe to consume.
</p>
<p>
This pertains to basic foods, not luxury goods. It means "the people" as a whole, not every individual separately.
</p>
<p>
The first pillar is Independence in Food Production and Distribution.
</p>

<a name="ovenergy"/>
<h3>1.3. Independence in Energy Production and Distribution</h3>

<p>
If our country depends on external sources of energy, or energy cannot be distributed to those who need it, then those who control the energy sources can dictate that our people conform to their values, deliver whatever they demand, and support their actions, whatever they may be.  
</p>
<p>
Therefore, our people can only be free if they can generate and distribute their own energy. It means "the people" as a whole, not every individual separately. 
</p>
<p>
The second pillar is Independence in Energy Production and Distribution.
</p>

<a name="ovdefense"/>
<h3>1.4. Independence in National Defense</h3>
<p>
If our country depends on external support for national defense, then those who provide such support can dictate that our people conform to their values, deliver whatever they demand, and support their actions, whatever they may be.  
</p>
<p>
Therefore, our people can only be free if they can defend the country without dependency on foreign sources of equipment, raw materials, or direct support. It means "the people" as a whole, not every individual separately. This means core homeland defenses, and not necessarily every weapon system deployed in every theater.
</p>
<p>
The third pillar is Independence in Defense.
</p>

<a name="successfactors"/>
<h2>2. Critical Success Factors</h2>
<p>
	Certain common success factors apply across the board. These include:
</p> 
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>decentralized capability in all three areas;</li>
		<li>robust and dependable interconnectivity among the decentralized sites (transportation, communication, and information infrastructure);</li>
        <li>systems that operate over a long span of time and that are designed for maintenance, technical updating, and functional improvement (sustainability);</li>
        <li>systems that can withstand substantial damage without losing functionality to a debilitating extent, and that can be restored to a fully functioning state in a reasonable time and at reasonable cost (resiliency);</li>
        <li>a population that is educated and well-informed about matters related to the three pillars (education); and</li>
        <li>consistent, mindful regulation, oversight, and enforcement of laws pertaining to public-sector and private-sector operations relevant to the three pillars (enforcement).</li>
    </ul> 
</p>
<p>
	Absent any one of these factors, the system will be unable to serve its purpose.
</p>

<a name="csdistribution"/>
<h3>2.1. Decentralized Capability</h3>
<p>
	If capability in any given area is concentrated in a few places, or if that capability depends on just one or two methods of production or distribution, then a well-planned attack or an unfortunate natural event that strikes just a few key targets has the potential to cripple the country. Therefore, it is important to design decentralized capability across the three pillars. 
</p>
<p>
	The concept of decentralization pertains to two aspects of these key activities: Physical distribution of production sites, and the use of multiple methods or techniques for any given production or distribution activity. 
</p>
<p>
	For the food pillar, this may mean both (a) multiple geographical areas producing similar foods and multiple locations for collecting, storing, and redistributing water; and (b) multiple agricultural and preparation methods for producing foods and multiple means of transporting foods across the country. 
</p>
<p>
	For the energy pillar, it may mean (a) energy production at the point of use, in local and regional grids, and in a national grid, with multiple redundant and severable connections; as well as (b) multiple energy production methods using different raw materials, and multiple methods of transmitting and storing energy.
</p>
<p>
	For the defense pillar, it may mean many more and smaller military bases, each with a range of capabilities and stores rather than a specialized function, and multiple redundant facilities for launching and landing aircraft and ships and multiple methods of moving personnel and equipment on land, sea, air, and in orbit.
</p>

<a name="redundancies"/>
<h3>2.2. Multiple Redundancies</h3>
<p>
	For all capabilities related to the Three Pillars of Independence, the country must have multiple backups and interconnections among the decentralized functional elements that can be activated, deactivated, and reconfigured in real time as events unfold. The general rule is that all nodes in a decentralized distribution network for food, energy, or defense assets must be connected to adjacent nodes by more than one alternative pathway, except nodes that are at the end of a distribution path, and that such alternative pathways can be engaged in less time than it takes for the outage to cause negative effects for the consumers or recipients. 
</p>
<p>
	For example, given an electricity-generating facility that supplies consumers in a particular region of the country, should the facility be taken offline abruptly by an unforeseen event (earthquake, flood, terrorist attack, equipment failure, etc.), the system must be designed so that electricity generated elsewhere in the network can be routed to the consumers normally served by the disabled facility. The switch must occur in less time than it takes for a consumer's local backup system (diesel-powered generator, battery system, etc.) to be exhausted It is reasonable to expect some kinds of consumers to have backup facilities (hospitals, government buildings, etc.). Private homes may not be equipped with backup electrical facilities, so the rerouting of electrical transmission must take place in less time than it would take for people's food supplies to be affected by the outage. 
</p>

<a name="csinfra"/>
<h3>2.3. Standards</h3>
<p>
    When economies of scale are achieved through the strategy of building many small copies of a resource and networking them together, rather than the strategy of building a few large resources, then it becomes important for functional elements of the system to be based on standard parts and interfaces. For example, in the present-day US, it is not feasible to remove control rods from a reactor in Plant A and insert them into a reactor in Plant B to deal with an emergency situation, because the parts are not interchangeable. The two plants might use some of the same parts, such as pressure relief values, but those parts are not installed in a way that facilitates rapid removal and replacement, or that allows removal while the plant remains operational. Standards are needed that allow nearly any part to be replaced with only minimal interruptions to operations. 
</p>
<p>
	A second consideration, mainly pertaining to the Defense Pillar, is the standardization of training and skill sets for the maintenance and operation of electrical generating facilities. If a power plant is attacked by a foreign enemy or terrorist group, the personnel working there may be killed. Personnel who work at other, similar facilities around the country must have the knowledge and skills to repair the damaged facility and bring it back online. 
</p>

<a name="csinfra"/>
<h3>2.4. Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
	For purposes of this backgrounder, <em>infrastructure</em> means the framework of connections among decentralized facilities. It includes any kind of interconnections that are relevant to the purpose and function of one or more of the three pillars of independence, such as transportation, communication, and information redundancy and sharing.
</p>

<a name="cssustainability"/>
<h3>2.5. Sustainability</h3>
<p>
	For purposes of this backgrounder, a <em>sustainable</em> solution is one that is designed to function for a long time without catastrophic breakdown, allows for ongoing maintenance and repair, is designed to be technically updated or extended, and is designed to enable functional improvement without requiring a full replacement of the system.  
</p>
		        
<a name="csresliency"/>
<h3>2.6. Resiliency</h3>
<p>
	For purposes of this backgrounder, a <em>resilient</em> solution is one that can absorb the impact of multiple technical failures, natural disasters, or intentional human sabotage or direct attacks at multiple sites and with multiple methods, while maintaining at least 50% of its normal service level to users, and that lends itself to rapid repair and restoration of full service at reasonable cost.
</p>

<a name="cseducation"/>
<h3>2.7. Education</h3>
<p>
	Nothing can ensure the functionality and robustness of the three pillars more effectively than a population that is well-informed about the value and importance of the interconnected systems, and their stake in the system's success. Elements of the State educational core curriculum will provide such education to young people, and an ongoing public outreach program will offer information and updates to the entire population. 
</p>

<a name="csenforcement"/>
<h3>2.8. Consistent Enforcement</h3>
<p>
	Almost every physical component of the systems that support the three pillars of independence will be designed, built, and operated by private sector companies on a for-profit basis. Private-sector companies are much better able to design and build capable and robust systems than any government agency could do. 
</p>
<p>
	The profit motive is a wonderful incentive, but there is a downside: Excessive greed can lead to short-term thinking. Long-term thinking is an absolute requirement of the three pillars. Therefore, business activities that pertain to the three pillars must be regulated to ensure the requirements for resiliency and sustainability are met. 
</p>
<p>
	The present-day practice in the US to accept the lowest bid for all projects, or to trade government contracts for financial or political favors, will not serve the needs of the people under the State system. The creativity and innovation of the private sector must be turned toward discovering cost-effective ways to meet the need, rather than clever ways to cut costs. 
</p>
<p>
	Undermining the three pillars will be a Category 1 offense under the State system. For some business leaders, this will be a difficult adjustment. Many of the things they have always done in the past, and that were rewarded financially and in terms of social status and power, will be treated as criminal offenses. Business operations in the three pillars will be highly lucrative, but 
</p>

<a name="foodpillar"/>
<h2>3. The Food Pillar</h2>

<p>
	Independence in food production, quality, and distribution does not mean that every food product Americans are accustomed to consuming must be produced domestically (although that <em>is</em> possible in future, in principle). The imported foods we enjoy are luxury items, not necessities. It may be hard for Americans to imagine life without coffee, tea, chocolate, Asian spices, European beer and wine, those special foreign cheeses, or year-round supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables without regard to season. The truth is that none of these things is mandatory for survival; in fact, they are not necessary for us to enjoy a wide variety of tasty and healthy foods. 
</p>

<a name="foodgoals"/>
<h3>3.1. Goals</h3>

<p>
	The basic goal of the food pillar is to create a sustainable system in which Americans' everyday lives are unaffected by any hostile action taken by a foreign power or a domestic terror/activist/revolutionary actor, up to and including nuclear war (short of an armageddon-style war), and any common natural phenomena such as floods, draught, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes, and meteor strikes. If they can't hurt us, then they can't take away our freedom. Of course, Americans in the immediate target zone of a major natural event or attack would be affected; but the nation as a whole would still have its food supply.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically, if America ever needed to manage entirely on domestic foods alone, that need would be temporary. It is far more likely that <em>some</em> food imports from <em>some</em> foreign trade partners would become unavailable during an international dispute. Eventually the dispute would be settled, or we would find alternative sources for our favorite imports, or a domestic industry would emerge to meet demand. 
</p>
<p>
	Even so, having the <em>ability</em> to live indefinitely - and <em>well</em> - without food imports puts America in a strong position. It means Americans' freedom cannot be compromised by any foreign actor putting pressure on our food supply.
</p>
			
<a name="foodstrengths"/>
<h3>3.2. Strengths</h3>

<p>
	The contiguous North American territory of the present-day US, and therefore of the proposed American State, includes most of the world's most desirable arable land. The land is well protected from external access by two large mountain ranges, but there are no significant barriers to movement of foods within the country.
</p>
<p>
	America is a leading producer of wheat, rice, and corn - the main staples of the human diet. The quality of beef raised in America is the best in the world - a status shared by some of our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. (Japanese Kobe beef is not a comparable product, as it is not accessible to most people due to its cost.) The other primary meats in Americans' diet, pork and chicken, are raised in abundance domestically. We also have other animals in large numbers that could be used for meat, if it became necessary - notably turkeys, ostriches, emus, rabbits, sheep, goats, and horses. Most Americans are unaccustomed to eating these animals, but that is a matter of habit and custom, not necessity.
</p>
<p>
	The climate zones and soil in different parts of America lend themselves to different types of crops, and for raising different kinds of food animals. Long coastlines along the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as numerous large lakes and rivers, are sources of a wide range of fish and other water-dwelling animals, both wild and farmed. 
</p>
<p>
	Many varieties of fruits and nuts grow natively in temperate latitudes, and America raises most of them. A few tropical fruits can be grown in the southern US on a seasonal basis. By taking better advantage of leading-edge agricultural technologies, including vertical farming, hydroponic and aeroponic growing methods, intensive water use reduction and water recycling, and genetic engineering, we can begin to provide a domestic supply of literally any and all plant-based foods - including our favorite imports, like coffee and chocolate.
</p>
<p>
	The regional river system is unparalleled anywhere else on the planet, and in modern times transportation infrastructure includes rail, highway, and air as well as river transport. 
</p>

<a name="foodvulnerabilities"/>
<h3>3.3. Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>
	To achieve economies of scale - and, unfortunately, to concentrate more wealth in the hands of the power elite - agriculture in the US has steadily become more and more centralized. Fewer and fewer companies (and the elite families behind them) control more and more of the food supply. The history behind this change is a disturbing account of the rich and powerful squeezing small farmers off the land and impoverishing them in order to increase profits only marginally. This is a glaring example of greed run amok.
</p>
<p>
	Occasionally we are reminded of the risks of centralization. During the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020-2021, reductions in output from just a couple of processing facilities had a severe impact on the supply of chicken to consumers. Fortunately, the shortage was temporary. Similarly, in the previous century, the epidemic of "mad cow disease" impacted America's supply of beef. 
</p>
<p>
	A decentralized system could have isolated these problems to one or two facilities, while leaving many more facilities in full operation. That would require a higher initial investment by the owners. The financial incentives at the time did not encourage them to do this. We can provide different incentives, and achieve better results.
</p>

<a name="foodstrategies"/>
<h3>3.4. Possible Strategies</h3>

<p>
	Under <em>vulnerabilities</em>, we noted that US agricultural companies have sought economies of scale by centralizing operations in a few very large facilities. Another, more sustainable way to achieve economies of scale is by decentralizing operations into a large number of much smaller facilities, distributed over a large geographical area. This approach results in a system that is more sustainable, resilient, and robust than a system that can be crippled by disabling a single facility, or a handful of facilities. 
</p>
<p>
	By taking advantage of modern technologies, most of these distributed facilities should, in principle, be able to produce almost any plant-based foodstuffs. We have options today that did not exist just a few years ago - indoor, underground, underwater, floating farms, and orbital food production facilities are all well-protected from variations in seasonal weather patterns, occasional extreme weather events, and long-term climate change. The decentralized approach also offers resiliency in the face of natural geological events, biological issues within a facility (a plant or animal disease, for instance) and human-instigated disruptions, as the workload of a disabled facility can be picked up by the rest of the network until the disabled facility is back online. 
</p>

<a name="foodtrade"/>
<h3>3.5. Implications for International Trade</h3>

<p>
	The shift from imperialism based on military force to international influence based on economic power means the State will use the advantages of America to improve our relationships with other countries. Philosophically, we intend this in a positive way. For Americans to be safe, prosperous, and free, our neighbors must also be safe, prosperous, and free. We can help them, and in so doing, help ourselves, as well. 
</p>
<p>
	We are convinced that this will be a more effective approach than forcing others to bend to our will at gunpoint. We believe it will be both easier and more cost-effective for us, too.
</p>
<p>
	But the real world is not all unicorns and rainbows. Every other government in the world is not interested in stability, prosperity, and peace. Some are interested in hegemony and global cultural dominance. Others may be unable to free themselves from their historical hatred of the old United States. Our advantages with respect to food production place us in a favorable position with respect to those actors, too. 
</p>
<p>
	Some analysts believe America could, in theory, feed itself and the rest of the world comfortably. If that is even partially true, then the situation provides immense leverage in international affairs. We need not impose sanctions or establish embargoes against anyone. All we need to do is provide them foodstuffs on favorable terms; an offer they can't refuse, so to speak. In any case, most of them can't <em>afford</em> to refuse.
</p>
<p>
	This strategy supports the defense pillar, as well. Would any foreign country destroy its own food supply? It is possible some foreign governments would be willing to do so, to prove the point that they hate America. But even for those governments, it would be perhaps the single stupidest decision they could possibly make. 
</p>


<a name="energypillar"/>
<h2>4. The Energy Pillar</h2>

<p>
	An aspect of sustainable independence is the ability of a country to provide for its own energy needs without dependencies on foreign supplies.
</p>

<a name="energygoals"/>
<h3>4.1. Goals</h3>

<p>
	The general goal of the energy pillar is to ensure that power continues to flow for all domestic users even when one or more nodes in the energy network is affected by natural or human-generated outages. Of course, the people living at or near the sites struck by a natural event, technical problem, or attack will necessarily be affected, but ideally the system as a whole continues to operate, with power routed around any problem spots, until all elements of the system have been restored to full operation. In addition to resiliency against natural events, technical issues, and attacks, we want to support routine maintenance and upgrades with minimal impact to users. 
</p>

<a name="energystrengths"/>
<h3>4.2. Strengths</h3>

<p>
	According to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php">United States Energy Information Administration</a>, as of 2021 the US produced over 4,000 billion kilowatthours of electricity from the following sources:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>natural gas (38.3%)</li>
		<li>coal (21.8%)</li>
		<li>nuclear (18.9%)</li>
		<li>renewables (20.1%)
            <ul>
		        <li>non-hydroelectric renewables (13.8%)
                    <ul>
		                <li>wind (11%)</li>
		                <li>solar (2.8%)</li>	
                    </ul>
                </li>
		        <li>hydroelectric renewables (6.3%)</li>	
		        </li>	
            </ul>
		</li>	
		<li>petroleum and other (0.9%)</li>	
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The same source reports a sharp upward trend in the use of wind and solar electricity generation. 
</p>
<p>
	In 2017, the US became a net exporter of natural gas, and has remained a net exporter until this writing (2022). Yet, the US imports natural gas, too. Almost all natural gas imports are from Canada, and nearly all of that comes by pipeline. 
</p>
<p>
	As of the start of 2021, the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) of coal was 472 short tons. This resource represents more potential energy generation than natural gas and petroleum reserves. 
</p>
<p>
	The US has been a net exporter of petroleum and petroleum products since 2020. Imports peaked in 2007. The US gradually shifted its sources for petroleum imports from OPEC countries to Canada. The US exports petroleum and petroleum liquids (mostly propane) to India, Mexico, South Korea, Canada, Netherlands, and China. 
</p>
<p>
	Sources of uranium for nuclear power plants came from these sources, as of 2021:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Kazakhstan (35%)</li>
		<li>Canada (15%)</li>
		<li>Australia (14%)</li>
		<li>Russia (14%)</li>
		<li>Namibia (7%)</li>
		<li>United States - domestic (5%)</li>
		<li>other (10%)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
	The information above pertains to industrial-scale power generation - the "grid." There is also a growing movement for homeowners to install solar panels on their houses. Usually, these are connected to the grid and pull power from the grid when the home's consumption exceeds the capacity of the solar panels on the house. In most locales, homeowners also sell their excess electricity back into the grid. In some cases, the homeowners install a battery system to store energy, and they can operate when the grid is down.
</p>
<p>
	Both the range of different types of electricity generation and the trends toward more-sustainable options are strengths for building the energy pillar.
</p>

<a name="energyvulnerabilities"/>
<h3>4.3. Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>
	The vulnerabilities in the present-day US power system are due to short-cuts taken in the interest of short-term and relatively small profits over long-term, substantial and sustainable profits. The root cause of nearly all the problems in the energy sector is simply the old question of delayed gratification; no more complicated than the well-known Marshmallow Experiment. 
</p>
<p>
	That experiment has been reevaluated and analyzed from various perspectives; in the present context, we choose to focus on the fact the test involved children. We assert that making choices in business that favor long-term, sustainable benefit is not difficult - it is, literally, child's play. Yet, American business leaders have demonstrated over many years that they are incapable of making, or unwilling to make those choices. They always eat the first marshmallow immediately. Far from being heroes of industry and noteworthy economic leaders, they are children who have no self-control.
</p>
<p>
	The companies responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the electrical grid have taken the cheapest possible approach to everything they have done, with a very short-term view. They would rather earn one dollar today, in a way that causes the system to fail next week, than to invest properly to set things up so that they can earn ten dollars next month, and every month thereafter. The problem manifests on multiple levels:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>the pursuit of economies of scale by the strategy of building relatively few large, centralized electrical generating plants;</li>
		<li>the complexity of the connections, which grew over a long period of time;</li>
		<li>delayed and careless maintenance and repairs of electrical equipment; and</li>
		<li>the repeated pattern of creating hard dependencies on foreign imports when such dependencies were unnecessary.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	It's true that economies of scale can be achieved by building one or a few very high-capacity electricity-generating facilities; but they can also be achieved by building a large number of much smaller facilities, networking them in a way that provides resiliency and flexibility. The initial costs may be higher, but the long-term benefits are much greater. 
</p>
<p>
	The resulting system is more flexible for routing power to wherever it is needed and for adjusting to localized peak demands; more resilient when equipment failures occur or when damage is done to some nodes; more cost-effective to maintain due to common designs and interchangeable components; safer due to the limited scope of events that affect small facilities on a local level. Overall quality of service is higher, as an outage in a small facility will affect far fewer people than an outage that affects an entire region of the country.
</p>
<p>
	In the nuclear energy sector, safety plays into this consideration, as well. Large reactors can develop unstoppable and deadly problems when things go wrong. Certain place names are remembered solely for such disasters, and are not known for anything else. Who today can tell us anything interesting about Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, or Fukushima that is unrelated to nuclear reactor failures? All these were large-scale facilities running multiple large reactors. A network of smaller reactors provides better safety, as a catastrophic failure of a small reactor can be contained and managed. 
</p>
<p>
	We attribute the choices made in the past to short-term greed. The State will encourage companies to consider long-term benefit above immediate profit. If they can but wait for the second marshmallow, their profits will be greater. Isn't that what they want - greater profit? If business leaders cannot see this, then the State will be a guide dog to lead them.
</p>
<p>
	The complexity of a system can be <em>necessary</em> or <em>arbitrary</em>. The complexity of the present power network is, in part, <em>necessary</em> - it is a complex job on the merits. But for the most part, the complexity of the system is <em>arbitrary</em>, resulting from a lack of planning for ongoing growth, upgrades, and maintenance. 
</p>
<p>
	In every case, new equipment is tacked onto the existing network in the cheapest way possible, with no thought to maintenance, longevity, resiliency, or future expansion. We attribute this to a combination of short-term greed in the private sector and Byzantine, overlapping, contradictory rules in the public sector owing to the large number of regulatory authorities in play - one of the many problems caused by having 50 separate states.
</p>
<p>
	The deterioration and failures of the grid over the years due to delays in maintenance, and in some cases failure to maintain the equipment at all, is another manifestation of short-term thinking and greed. Over time, it is less costly to keep the equipment in good working order than it is to cross our fingers and hope for the best in order to avoid maintenance costs altogether. 
</p>
<p>
	In the post World War II period, the US established economic hegemony over the world by opening up free trade and defending global shipping lanes with the US Navy. Over time, this has had both positive and negative effects for the US and for the world. One reality during this period is that the US really has <em>not absolutely required</em> any imports of raw materials for energy production, but purchased imports anyway to stimulate global trade. 
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, American companies and consumers came to depend on these imports, and when events occurred that made it harder to get such imports at low cost (like the formation of OPEC in the 1970s), the national economy was unable to adjust quickly. This happened because of short-term greed - the cheapest thing American companies could possibly do was to sit back and allow the imports to come flooding in; they didn't bother with back-up plans, and weren't prepared to pivot away from the imports when the time came to do so. 
</p>
<p>
	The State will use economic generosity as a tool of foreign policy as well, but will take care not to create unnecessary dependencies when in fact an import agreement is meant to serve a strategic purpose. America has the resources to take care of itself; we don't need hard dependencies on foreign sources. Our import-export strategy is just that - a strategy. 
</p>

<h4>4.3.1. Electrical Grid</h4>

<p>
	The electrical grid is fragile, and Americans have enjoyed amazing good luck. The occasional large-scale outage demonstrates how little it takes to deny power to large swathes of the US. 
</p>
<p>
	In 1965, 30 million people in the northeastern US were without power for 13 hours. The cause was sloppy maintenance work. Someone set protective relays incorrectly, and a small power surge tripped the relay and deactivated the transmission line. The event is popularly called the Northeast Blackout of 1965.
</p>
<p>
	In 1977, New York City suffered a blackout due to a single lightning strike on a single substation. Thanks to sloppy maintenance work (loose locking nuts), the power remained off long enough for two subsequent lightning strikes to take down the largest generator for the city. 
</p>
<p>
	In 1979, equipment failures at the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, caused a meltdown of one of the facility's nuclear reactor cores. The main equipment failure was a stuck relief valve, which prevented heat from being removed from one of the cores. Subsequent actions by plant operators exacerbated the problem, before they realized there was a problem with the valve. Fortunately, there were no lasting adverse effects, although about 2 million people were exposed to some level of radiation.
</p>
<p>
	In late 1982, high winds along the west coast of the US knocked over a transmission tower, which crashed into a line tower, in turn causing three more towers to fall. Backup plans failed because they were not designed to handle an outage of such scope. Communication problems exacerbated the problem and delayed repairs. 
</p>
<p>
	High demand during the hot summer of 1996 overloaded the grid and caused two massive power outages affecting Idaho, Utah, and California. About two million people were affected. Fortunately, service was restored within a couple of hours. 
</p>
<p>
	A powerful lightning storm in Minnesota in 1998 took out a power line, causing a transmission failure. A second lightning strike broke the connection between transmission lines. The northern Midwest was separated from the Eastern grid, and people in the upper Midwest and central Canada were without power for 19 hours. 
</p>
<p>
	In 2019, the Camp Fire in California was caused by faulty power lines installed through forested land, at two ignition points. Dry vegetation, high winds, high temperatures, and low humidity, sped the spread of the fire once it started. The fire killed 85 people, destroyed 153,000 acres of forest, and destroyed 19,000 houses and other buildings. 
</p>
<p>
	In 2021, during an uncharacteristically severe winter, the Texas power grid experienced major outages. The event is considered the worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas history. Between 246 (confirmed) and 702 (estimated) people died. Over 4.5 million homes and businesses were without electricity, and there were shortages of water, food, and heat. Total financial damage exceeded $195 billion. All the problems were caused by inadequate maintenance and contingency planning - failure to winterize equipment exposed to the weather. The maintenance failures were caused, in turn, by greed and short-term thinking.
</p>
<p>
	It is remarkable that more outages and other incidents related to the electrical grid have not occurred over the years. The system has not been significantly upgraded, protected, or made redundant based on these experiences. Power companies and regulatory agencies continue to operate as if nothing had ever gone wrong and there were no lessons to be learned. 
</p>
<p>
	The common causes of all these events are:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>power lines are installed above ground on poles and towers, instead of below ground within conduits designed and built for resiliency and ease of maintenance - more costly initially, but less risky and less costly to maintain;</li>
    	<li>careless maintenance - setting relays incorrectly, leaving locking bolts unsecured, and allowing equipment installed in remote locations to deteriorate without inspection or repair; and</li>
    	<li>the generally haphazard growth of the grid, which is really a number of separate grids that are interconnected in <em>ad hoc</em> ways, and that include a great deal of very old equipment.</li>
    </ul>  
</p>

<p>
	The condition of the electrical grid(s) in the US poses a direct risk not only to the delivery of power to users, but also to the food and defense pillars. It would be easy to cripple the US by attacking a handful of well-selected targets. Assuming the State system is implemented, correcting this will be among the first priorities of the State.
</p>


<h4>4.3.2. Fuel for Industry and Transportation</h4>

<p>
	According to the US Energy Information Administration as of 26 July, 2022, US domestic <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET_MOVE_IMPCUS_A2_NUS_EPPR_IM0_MBBL_M.htm">field production of crude oil</a> stands at approximately 12 million barrels per day, subject to some variation, while <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET_MOVE_IMPCUS_A2_NUS_EPPR_IM0_MBBL_M.htm">the country imports</a> about 6.8 million barrels per day, with OPEC members accounting for roughly one tenth of the imports. At the same time, the US <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mcrexus2&f=m">exports</a> about 3.2 million barrels per day. 
</p>
<p>
	Our rough, and probably naive analysis is that as of the time of writing the US produces nearly twice as much crude oil as it imports, and is not strongly dependent on OPEC countries for the imports. Exports amount to about half of the imported quantity. If we produce 12 million barrels per day, import another 6.8 million, and export 3.2 million, then our domestic demand is about 15.6 million barrels per day. 
</p>
<p>
	The US appears able to use petroleum import and export levels to direct the global economy to some extent, although there are other players who can push their own petroleum policies without the approval of the US. Of the imports, about 3.5 million barrels per day come from Mexico, a friendly country; but about 1.6 million barrels per day come from Russia, a country openly hostile to the US. This suggests there is more to the story than straightforward business transactions. Meanwhile, the US imports no petroleum from Venezuela, a country from which we bought significant quantities of crude before the Chavez regime overturned democracy there. This is another indication that the US is successfully using petroleum to support foreign policy. 
</p>
<p>
	According to the same source, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPTX2&f=M">Texas field production</a> amounts to slightly more than 5 million barrels per day, a significant proportion of total US production. As the State intends to separate Texas from America, this poses a risk to the energy pillar. While the State plans to treat the new nation of Texas as a Category 2 country (principal trade partner) as well as Category 3 (immediate neighbor with a land border) and Category 4 (resident of our "neighborhood" - the Americas), there is no guarantee that Texas would consider the new America to be a friendly country or a desirable business partner. Even if they do so, they may decide other customers are more lucrative for their petroleum exports. 
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, America must be prepared to meet domestic demand, including growth until such time as alternative fuels become mainstream. Of course, all the numbers will change with the absence of Texas. Part of US demand comes from there, and some US imports go to support Texas. To compute the demand in the American State <em>sans</em> Texas, we used the figures from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/481424/leading-us-states-in-energy-consumption-from-natural-gas/">Statista</a> for Texas consumption of 6,185.8 trillion British Thermal Units for petroleum, and 4,708.4 BTU for natural gas. Given a barrel of oil produces about 5.8 x 10<sup>6</sup> BTU at 59&deg; F, the demand in the American State would be about 1.06 million barrels per day lower than it is with Texas consumption included. 
</p>
<p>
	That leaves us with domestic demand of about 14.5 million barrels per day, against domestic field production of about 7 million barrels per day. If we continued to import 6.8 million barrels per day, that would result in total supplies of 13.8 million barrels per day; short of total demand, but still manageable. Should Texas provide some level of imports - say, 2 million barrels per day - our domestic demand would be covered, for the present. 
</p>
</p>
	That situation is tenable and probably stable, but does not meet the criterion of complete energy independence. The State would pursue a multifaceted program to develop full energy independence. This would be necessary in any case, as petroleum and other fossil fuels are non-renewable resources, and supplies have already reached the stage when extraction is becoming prohibitively expensive. Therefore, the general dependence of America on petroleum products is, in itself, a risk to the energy pillar and, by extension, the defense pillar.
</p>
<p>
	On an interim basis, America would need to increase domestic production by a couple million barrels per day - possibly an unpopular move with voters, but not a permanent situation. Americans currently pay far less for fuel at the pump than the residents of any other industrialized nation, and yet there is much noise about high prices due to the sanctions on Russian exports in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Those prices are roughly half what Europeans pay, but higher than they were before the invasion, so Americans feel the pinch. Our short-term moves to meet domestic demand would likely increase fuel prices at the pump still further. 
</p>

<h4>4.3.3. Uranium Supply</h4>
<p>
	Partisan political rhetoric in the US <em>circa</em> 2022 overstates the importance of imported uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia, and speculates that Bill and Hillary Clinton personally set up deals to hand over control of US uranium resources to Russia. There is a germ of truth in all that, and a great deal of politically-motivated exaggeration and outright lies. More significant is the fact some 40% of the uranium loaded into US reactors is imported. 
</p>
<p>
	This is a serious risk for the energy and defense pillars. Just <em>how</em> serious depends on who is talking. The oil industry publication, <em>Oil Price</em>, insists fears are exaggerated. We see this publication as a mouthpiece for the power elite, and likely to frame information in a way that is favorable to "big oil" interests. Fox News claims the US is overreliant on uranium imports, and is vulnerable to foreign influence as a result. We consider this news source to be heavily biased in favor of extreme political views, and they often report news in a way that can bring harm to the United States; some of their reporting could be prosecuted under the State system as stochastic terrorism. 
</p>
<p>
	Filtering for bias due to greed and political extremism, we find there really is a strong dependency on foreign sources of uranium. This kind of dependency is contrary to the principles of the State, whether the dependency is on a friendly country like Canada or a hostile one like Russia.
</p>
<p>
	The reason for concern about Russia is a series of business moves by Russian state-owned nuclear energy company, Rosatom, to acquire full control of the Canadian company, Uranium One, from 2009 to 2013. Uranium One's American subsidiaries Uranium One USA and Uranium One Americas had owned and operated advanced uranium processing plants in Wyoming - Jab and Antelope, Moore Range, and Willow Creek. Rosatom acted through its own subsidiary in Russia, ARMZ. Having gained full control of Uranium One, ARMZ reorganized the company as Uranium One Holding, and delisted it from the Toronto Stock Exchange. In effect, this gives Russia control of about 20% of US uranium production capacity, but no ownership of existing stockpiles. 
</p>
<p>
	Under the State system, foreign ownership of any American resources pertinent to the Three Pillars is illegal. One of the first acts of the State will be to purchase (from friendly nations) or expropriate (from unfriendly nations) foreign-owned assets such as uranium mines and processing facilties located in America. Russia will make noise, but will do nothing about it physically. The State recognizes Russia as openly hostile toward America, with the desire and the potential to become an existential threat. The State also considers Russia a special case due to Russian ambitions for global hegemony. In a nutshell, the State will not wait long before taking control of these assets, and will not ask Russia's permission to do so. 
</p>

<h3>4.4. Possible Strategies</h3>

<h4>4.4.1. Assessment, Upgrade, and Strengthening of the Electrical Grid</h4>
<p>
	The electrical grid is the transmission and delivery network for electrical energy, regardless of how the energy is produced. 
</p>
<p>
	We consider this the single most urgent problem to solve for the energy pillar. This will involve expensive, long-term upgrades to the entire electrical grid. The first step is likely to be the establishment of new standards, developed with an eye toward ongoing maintenance, high reliability, resiliency, and quality of service. 
</p>
<p>
	Rather than solutions whose initial installation is cheap, we need to focus on systems that do the job we need done. That means multiple, redundant, and fail-safe connections to enable re-routing of power as needed when outages occur. If routine and predictable causes like lightning strikes, high winds, cold weather, or the Aurora Borealis literally fry the equipment, then the system is not resilient. That level of quality will no longer be acceptable. There are ways to engineer these systems so that they are not so fragile. 
</p>
<p>
	It is a question of willingness to invest, and willingness to delay gratification (profit). Given the facts that (under the State system) undermining the Three Pillars of Independence is a Category 1 offense, and incorporation does not provide a legal shield for corporate executives against responsibility for the harm their decisions cause, we are hopeful that industry leaders will learn to wait for the second marshmallow. They will still increase their personal wealth; it will happen next week instead of today. We assert this is neither (a) asking too much of them, nor (b) any infringement of their rights to operate a business for profit.
</p>
<p>
	Based on the new standards, upgrades to the existing equipment must be coordinated with planning for the decentralized system we need to have in place to support the energy and defense pillars. All new installations will follow the revised standards. Changes to existing equipment and transmission routes are likely to take many years and be very costly to implement. 
</p>
<p>
	Some aspects of electrical grid upgrading and some design considerations for new equipment are based on the vulnerability of the system to electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects. This pertains to protection of the electrical system against natural phenomena, particularly lightning, but also connects with the Defense Pillar, as EMP weapons are an existing category of threat for which the US currently has no protection. This is discussed under defense vulnerabilities in section 5.3.4 of this document, and under possible defense strategies in section 5.4.5.4.
</p>
<p>
	Modernizing the grid will probably be the single largest, most expensive, and most time-consuming part of building the energy pillar. There is no point in trying to soften this message. The investment is absolutely necessary for our national sovereignty, independence, and sustainable freedom.
</p>

<h4>4.4.2. Expansion of Solar Generation Capacity at Point of Use</h4>
<p>
	In the present-day US, more and more homeowners are purchasing solar energy systems for their houses. The State will provide economic incentives to encourage this trend. We will also encourage the installation of solar energy systems on commercial buildings, at industrial facilities, and on multi-family housing buildings. For Americans who are not in a financial position to purchase solar energy systems, the State will offer subsidies. Public housing projects will include solar energy systems as part of their basic design - either point of use or neighborhood level systems.
</p>
<p>
	Systems that serve a neighborhood rather than a single house will be a cost-effective option in many situations. This approach offers most of the advantages of point of use energy production along with some economies of scale. Neighborhood systems can be rolled out faster than systems installed on individual homes, and access for maintenance and upgrades will be easier. However, a planned or unplanned outage will affect more people than with point of use generation. 
</p>

<h4>4.4.3. Expansion of Solar and Wind Capacity Based on a Decentralized Model</h4>
<p>
	Grid-scale energy production will probably remain a part of the overall solution, even if it is no longer the primary basis of the system. The State will encourage new and upgraded large-scale generation facilities to shift to solar and wind technologies, and will phase out technologies that depend on (a) foreign sources of raw materials, (b) raw materials that cannot be replaced, and (c) methods that have a significant negative environmental impact. 
</p>

<h4>4.4.4. Exploration of Alternative Battery Technologies and Battery Production Methods</h4>
<p>
	It is desirable to move away from fossil fuels for energy production, but there is no such thing as a magic bullet. With the increased use of batteries comes increased environmental impact from their production. Current lithium-ion battery technology depends on mining and processing lithium. Present methods of mining and processing lithium have severe environmental impact. By increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries, we will simultaneously increase this environmental impact. 
</p>
<p>
	According to the <a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/the-environmental-impact-of-lithium-batteries/">Institute for Energy Research</a>, the process to extract lithium ore uses "approximately 500,000 gallons [of water] per metric ton of lithium. To extract lithium, miners drill a hole in salt flats and pump salty, mineral-rich brine to the surface. After several months the water evaporates, leaving a mixture of manganese, potassium, borax, and lithium salts which is then filtered and placed into another evaporative pool. After between 12 and 18 months of this process, the mixture is filtered sufficiently that lithium carbonate can be extracted."
</p>
<p>
	Lithium processing involves caustic and poisonous chemicals, including hydrochloric acid, and it is common for these chemicals to leak from the processing facilities into the local watter supply. China, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Tibet, Australia, and the United States have suffered environmental damage from lithium production. Damage affects the soil, air, and water. Dead animals have been found floating downriver from production sites; in Nevada, as far as 150 miles away from the production site.
</p>
<p>
	A related problem is the disposal and/or recycling of lithium waste from spent batteries and discarded devices. Some of this waste could be used to produce new batteries, thus reducing demand for fresh mining and processing operations. Other forms of disposal and recycling could, at least, reduce the overall environmental impact of the industry. The Institute for Energy Research estimates that in China alone, recycling lithium to produce batteries (less efficient than new ones, but still functional), "for China's 5G stations or...shared e-bikes" could save 63 million tons of carbon emissions compared with manufacturing those batteries new.
</p>
<p>
	The State will promote, and if necessary directly fund and direct, research into improved methods of lithium production, improved processes for the disposal and recycling of lithium, and new types of batteries that do not depend on dangerous chemicals in the first place. There are no guarantees of when or to what extent this research will bear fruit.
</p>
<p>
	We are encouraged by some contemporary developments in this area. An Australian company started by two University of Melbourne students, Relectrify, has developed a way to repurpose lithium-ion batteries from vehicles to power home electrical systems. It takes much more energy to move a vehicle than it does to power the lights and appliances in a home. When lithium-ion batteries are no longer capable of powering a car, they still contain as much as 80% of their energy potential. Relectrify can repurpose these batteries for use in home electrical systems. 
</p>
<p>
	A technical improvement that may be useful as an interim solution is the lithium-sulfur battery. At the time of writing, people are working to overcome some of the technical challenges with this technology - in particular, the rapid degradation of the electrodes - but the technology may offer 40% higher energy density and lower production costs than lithium-ion batteries. 
</p>
<p>
	An improvement such as lithium-sulfur technology would reduce the environmental impact of battery production and disposal, but not eliminate the problem of lithium mining and processing. There is a technology "arms race" in progress, with companies and universities experimenting with alternatives to lithium-ion batteries. People involved in these efforts always say they are on the verge of a breakthrough. Maybe some of them are right.
</p>
<p>
	But most of these ideas do not get us away from caustic chemicals. For instance the redox flow battery is a dual-liquid battery that uses hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. Stanford University has been experimenting with aluminum-graphite battery technology; this is at an early stage of research. MIT and Samsung are working on solid-state battery technology. These options still depend on basic materials that are currently used in commercially-available batteries or that are equally dangerous.
</p>
<p>
	More-exotic directions of research include graphene superconductors, which are not exactly batteries at all. Theoretically, these can charge and discharge more efficiently than a battery and last much longer, although they do not hold as much energy per unit of volume as a battery. To bring this technology to market will require significant advances in nanotechnology. Even more exotic, and at an even more preliminary stage of development, is the bioelectrochemical battery. This technology, being investigated in the Netherlands, uses anaerobic bacteria to process acetate that releases electrons through reduction/oxidation. 
</p>
<p>
	While the alternatives to lithium-ion technology are not commercially viable at this time, the activity in this space tells us that people are creative and clever about developing new energy technology, and one or more of their ideas will ultimately become viable. We need to design our future energy solutions to be upgradeable as new solutions emerge.
</p>

<h4>4.4.5. "Clean Coal" as a Backup Energy Source</h4>
<p>
	As noted above under <em>strengths</em>, US reserves of coal exceed the energy potential of petroleum and gas reserves. Coal still in the ground is a tremendous resource, too.
</p>
<p>
	Clearly, we do not want to use coal as our primary energy source. There are significant health and safety issues in the mining and processing of coal, and severe negative environmental impact when it is burned. However, we cannot ignore the coal reserves as a backup resource in case international tensions force America to fend for itself temporarily on occasion. 
</p>
<p>
	To that end, the State will encourage two developments: First, a reasonable number of coal-powered electrical generating facilities will keep their coal equipment in place, maintain it, and periodically fire it up to ensure it is usable and that the nation can pivot to coal quickly, without interrupting service to customers. Second, those plants will be fitted with so-called "clean coal" technology, so that when we do resort to burning coal we are doing it in the most environmentally-responsible way possible. 
</p>

<h4>4.4.6. Shale as a Backup Energy Source</h4>

<p>
	American territory is rich with shale oil deposits. Unfortunately, the methods for extracting this resource are both unpopular and environmentally damaging: horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. 
</p>
<p>
	When those technologies first became viable at scale, the oil industry was eager to take advantage of them. There was a big push to develop shale resources rapidly, with little or no regard for the impact - another example of eating the first marshmallow.
</p>
<p>
	The State would not emphasize shale as a ready resource to be exploited immediately, but would treat it as a strategic reserve. At times when it is not possible for America to meet its energy needs in more-desirable and more-sustainable ways, we can exploit shale oil.
</p>
<p>
	As unkind as it may sound, the State would be interested in importing petroleum products derived from shale oil extraction in other countries. This approach preserves our own non-renewable resource and avoids damaging our own natural environment.
</p>

<h4>4.4.7. Interim Strategy for Petroleum</h4>

<p>
	Currently, the US uses petroleum primarily to power vehicles; less than 1% of commercial electricity production is based on petroleum. As we move away from petroleum, we may use petroleum imports and exports to support foreign policy goals. When we increase or decrease imports for this reason, our energy sector must not take every change as permanent or dependable. They must operate in a way that enables them to pivot quickly. They need to learn to wait for the second marshmallow.
</p>
<p>
	We may adjust petroleum imports and exports to assist other nations in economic growth or political stabilization, or to encourage or discourage policies of other governments, and not simply as a way to support domestic demand. As the State will not use imperialistic methods (read: military aggression) to gain international leverage, economic methods will play a larger role than they do at present. 
</p>
<p>
	In addition, petroleum is a non-renewable resource; once it has been used, it is gone forever. Therefore, there is some value in using other countries' petroleum reserves and holding our own against future needs. This will help us maintain a strong economic position internationally in the long term.
</p>

<h4>4.4.8. Interim Strategy for Nuclear Energy</h4>
<p>
	Continued use of nuclear power generation makes sense as an interim measure during the transition to more-sustainable energy production methods. However, expansion of nuclear generation capacity may not make sense. Should expansion be necessary, the State would avoid building any more very large nuclear plants, in favor of building much smaller plants, geographically distributed and redundantly networked. Longer term, the strategy is to phase out nuclear energy as more alternative methods come online.
</p>
<p>
	There are two factors that rule out nuclear energy as a long-term strategy. The first is the problem of disposing of the spent nuclear fuel. The second is the question of sourcing uranium, a non-renewable resource for which we cannot meet demand from domestic sources alone. 
</p>
<p>
	Safety concerns are largely solved by building small reactors rather than large ones. The technology as such is quite reliable. It is the scale of nuclear "incidents" that raises safety concerns. Historically, there have been very few such events, notwithstanding the age of most of the equipment in use, and all the incidents were directly caused by human carelessness. 
</p>

<h4>4.4.9. Exploration of Alternative Vehicle Propulsion Technologies</h4>
<p>
	In the present-day US, nearly all vehicles (except experimental ones) are powered by gasoline, diesel, or rechargeable batteries; some city buses in urban centers use liquified natural gas (LNG). But these are not the only technologies in use for vehicles around the world. Other choices include biodiesel, methane, LNG, and hydrogen fuel cell (electric). In some countries, multiple fuel technologies are in use concurrently as the country gradually phases out high-emission vehicles. When you visit a "gas station" or "petrol station" in one of those countries, you find different pumps for different fuels.
</p>
<p>
	There have been other solutions in the past, including steam and turbine engines. Those two have certain inconveniences that make them impractical at scale, but their existence demonstrates that people can come up with innovative solutions to problems; we may see practical ideas for alternative propulsion in future, if we provide incentives for people to explore them. 
</p>
<p>
	We recall a story of "hillbilly engineering" years ago, when a man designed and built a wood-burning "reactor" to produce hydrogen to run his pickup truck (not a hydrogen fuel cell solution). The device filled the bed of his truck and took 20 minutes to start, but he got the equivalent of 3,000 miles per gallon in fuel efficiency. Developed further, the technology is called a <em>wood gasifier</em> (see article in <a href="https://www.motherearthnews.com/sustainable-living/renewable-energy/turn-wood-into-free-motor-fuel-with-a-wood-gasifier-zbcz1506/">Mother Earth News</a>). Innovative thinking like this will lead to solutions we cannot predict. 
</p>
<p>
	The main practical factor that has made it difficult for the US to adopt alternative vehicle propulsion systems is the physical size of the country. For a technology like, say, hydrogen fuel cells to become widely used in the US, hydrogen fuel stations would have to be set up on all Interstate highways and other major roadways, as well as throughout every city and town. As of 2020, the Interstate system alone had 48,756 miles (78,465 km) of roadways. To phase in technologies that can be fully supported by domestic sources, and that are more environmentally-friendly than current options, would require many years of carefully-managed change, and would involve supporting multiple technologies simulaneously in many thousands of fuelling stations.
</p>
<p>
	An idea that has been tried before on a limited basis is the powered roadway. Rather than having each vehicle propel itself, the vehicles draw power from the roadway. To retrofit the Interstate highway system in this way (not to mention general roads) would be cost-prohibitive, and may never serve more than a small percentage of vehicles that use the system. Besides, a vehicle parked at someone's house would need a way to move itself <em>to</em> the nearest powered roadway, so this approach may add problems rather than solving them. However, powered roadways could be a good solution for local traffic within urban areas, especially types of vehicles that must be in motion most of the time and that tend to travel prescribed routes repeatedly, such as buses and delivery vans.

<h4>4.4.10. Assessment of Costs and Benefits of Urban Redesign for Energy Efficiency</h4>
<p>
	Technological change in the past few decades has made it unnecessary for human societies to have very large urban centers where most of the economic activity is concentrated, with people commuting in and out of the city center every day. But the cities are already in place, and they aren't going anywhere. Can we plan our way toward a more effective energy strategy for our cities?
</p>
<p>
	Most cities originate as trading posts, manufacturing centers, or transportation hubs and grow in an <em>ad hoc</em> way known as "urban sprawl," but many are planned. It has been a practice for several millennia for people to design their capital cities explicitly for the purpose. Excluding examples from ancient history, these include Mexico City, Mexico (1520s); Washington DC, US (1791); Adelaide, Australia (1836); Brasilia, Brazil (1960); Abuja, Nigeria (1980s); Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan (1990s); and Naypyidaw, Myanmar (2005). 
</p>
<p>
	Others are provincial/regional/state capitals, like Columbus, Ohio, US (1812); Salt Lake City, Utah, US (1847); Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan (1870s); and Dimitrovgrad, Haskovo, Bulgaria (1947). Some were and are planned as business/industrial/mining and residential centers, like El Salvador, Chile (1950s); Novopolotsk, Belarus (1958); Tsukuba Science City, Japan (1960s); Belmopan, Belize (1970); Fontvieille, Monaco (1970s-1990s); Modi'in, Israel (1993); Lusail, Qatar (current); Konza Technopolis, Kenya (current); Pegasus, New Zealand (current); New Administrative Capital, Egypt (current); Badr, Egypt (current); Purbachal Residential Model Town, Bangladesh (current); and Al Duqm, Oman (current). Many others appear in lists of planned cities, although they are not complete cities but only educational, industrial, scientific, or residential developments within or near existing urban centers.  
</p>
<p>
	A key point for us to keep in mind when attempting to plan urban change for purposes of building the energy pillar is best captured by poet Robert Burns in his poem, <em>To a mouse</em>: "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men, Gang aft a-gley." Not a single one of these planned cities continued to function for very long according to its original plan. It is a virtual certainty that none of those still in the planning stages today will continue to look and operate they way their planners envision. Epcot Center, an attraction at Disney World in Florida, was originally planned as a high-tech model residential community that would have a permanent population. It never came close to fulfilling that purpose.
</p>
<p>
	Even so, some cities have been able to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion while freeing up space previously used for parking, at least in their central cores. Massive physical changes in existing cities are not feasible. Practical changes that may potentially improve our energy consumption patterns include relatively minor adjustments, like restricting vehicles of certain types from specific sections of a city; planting rooftop gardens, planting vegetation along the medians of wide streets; replacing the windows in high-rise buildings with energy-efficient glass; changing the ventilation and air conditioning systems in high-rise buildings; encouraging the use of mass transit options over personal cars; changing patterns of lighting usage to reduce consumption; adjusting thermostats on air conditioning and heating systems; renovating older industrial and warehouse districts into pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use developments; blocking off sections of several square blocks from vehicular traffic; and changes of similar scope. 
</p>

<h4>4.4.11. Assessment of Costs and Benefits of Expanded Rail Capacity</h4>
<p>
	The US was among the first countries to build a nationwide rail network. To this day, rail transport is one of the most important ways goods make their way across the country. But the US has never fully exploited the potential of rail passenger service. In part, this has been due to the political influence of the oil industry and the automobile industry. It is not too late for America to build a robust passenger rail system for intercity travel. This would reduce air traffic, pollution, and overall transportation costs. 
</p>
<p>
	Air travel is most economical for long-distance trips in which a large aircraft carries many passengers. Operating medium sized and small passenger aircraft on short routes is far less cost-effective (except Alaska). Shifting to passenger rail for the majority of regional intercity travel would improve the cost-benefit ratio of the air travel industry, which rarely has turned a profit on its own merits. It would also result in clearer skies and a less stressful travel experience for passengers. 
</p>
<p>
	Due to the size of the country, air would almost certainly remain the first choice for longer trips. But for short hauls - for instance, Dallas to Oklahoma City - there is little difference in total time spent between ground travel and air travel. That example is about 35 minutes of flight time versus 3 hours of driving time (longer by bus); but by the time a traveler has done all the things necessary before boarding and after disembarking the aircraft, total door-to-door travel time is no different. A high-speed rail line between those two cities would deliver passengers in about 1 hour 20 minutes; with pre-boarding and post-disembarking travel steps, it works out to about 3 hours again. And that is only one example out of hundreds. 
</p>

<a name="defensepillar"/>
<h2>5. The Defense Pillar</h2>

<p>
	A country that is dependent on others for defense faces three serious limitations to its sovereignty and the freedom of its people. First, the country must enter into mutual defense pacts with others, and will be obligated to spend blood and treasure on behalf of other countries when those countries request it. Second, when their own country is attacked, they are at the mercy of others to come to their aid, choosing to spend <em>their</em> blood and treasure to help. They might help and they might not. Third, under threat from other countries, they have little choice but to submit to nearly any demands made on them to avoid conflict, including demands that are contrary to their own values and principles, and contrary to their material interest.
</p>
<p>
	The American State may choose to spend blood and treasure on behalf of others, when doing so supports the overarching purpose of the State to establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty without external interference. But in principle we do not want to be placed in a position where we have no choice in the matter. Similarly, we may request assistance from others when the need arises to defend our country; and similarly, we do not want to be placed in a position where we have no choice but to hope for outside assistance. Finally, and most importantly, we want our people to be free to live as they choose to live and to decide with whom they wish to do business without having to compromise their own values. 
</p>

<a name="defensegoals"/>
<h3>5.1. Goals</h3>

<p>
	The goal of the Defense Pillar is to prevent, forestall, reduce the risk of, mitigate the effects of, and punish or eliminate anyone and anything that threatens the ability of Americans to live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty without external interference, including threats and/or attacks originating from inside or outside America. 
</p>
<p>
	Unsurprisingly, the conventional notion of the role of the military plays a central part in the Defense Pillar; but we consider several kinds of threats as equally dangerous to the American people:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Kinetic - physical threats and attacks (bombs, missiles, guns, nuclear-chemical-biological weapons);</li>
		<li>Cybernetic - electronic warfare techniques and the use of network technology to carry out criminal acts;</li>
		<li>Propagandistic - misinformation and disinformation intended to degrade the cohesiveness of American society, to sow discord and mistrust among Americans, or to foment the violent overthrow of the government (stochastic terrorism); and</li>
		<li>Acts that undermine the Three Pillars of Independence.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The first three of those threat categories can involve either domestic or foreign actors, or a combination. The last category pertains to domestic actors. The State is justified, by definition, in responding to a cyberattack with physical force, to eliminate both the equipment used in the attack and the people with the skills to launch future attacks of the same kind.  
</p>
<p>
	Propagandistic attacks may be prosecuted under anti-terrorism statutes. The rhetoric would have to go beyond what a normal person would consider the free expression of a dissenting opinion. It would have to be shown in court that the effect of the speech was to undermine the nation. Statutory law under the State system first considers whether harm has been done, and then the type of harm, and then the extent of the harm. The perpetrator's <em>intent</em> is considered during sentencing, but the crime occurs when the <em>harm</em> occurs. In the present-day US, unless the rhetoric names a target and explicitly calls for violence, the speech cannot be prosecuted. Under State law, some forms of speech would be considered <em>stochastic terrorism</em>, and could be prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>
	Acts that undermine the Three Pillars of Independence may include minor crimes such as vandalism and theft, if the crimes involve assets connected with the Food, Energy, or Defense Pillars. Acts in this category may also include "business" crimes - business activities that weaken the Three Pillars in the pursuit of short-term gain, for example. 
</p>

<a name="defensestrengths"/>
<h3>5.2. Strengths</h3>

<p>
	If implemented, the American State would inherit two primary strengths from the US in regard to the Defense Pillar. The first is the geography of the country, as described previously. The second is the world economic order that the US established in the wake of World War II. 
</p>

<h4>5.2.1. The Bretton Woods System</h4>

<p>
	Peter Zeihan summarizes the Bretton Woods Agreement well in his 2014 book, <em>The Accidental Superpower</em>. Our take in a nutshell, plus a couple of other salient points: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>The US emerged from the war as the only global power; the USSR was a second near-global power, but lacked some of the advantages the US enjoyed; in fact, the USSR benefited from US assistance in rebuilding after the war. No other country was in a position to bootstrap itself after the war.</li>
	    <li>US military power was based on its navy; in the late 1940s, it was the only global naval force. Former maritime powers like Japan and Great Britain had lost most of their fleets. The US formula for military success was rapid deployment anywhere, rapid and decisive defeat of enemy forces, and timely withdrawal, before it became necessary to "manage" or "rule" the defeated country.</li>
	    <li>The US mainland was largely untouched by the war; industrial capacity was still intact, cities were still standing, and American forces had suffered fewer casualties than other participants in the war (on either side).</li>
	    <li>The US ended up in possession of a number of small territories in the Pacific and Caribbean that were critical staging points for naval operations and global trade.</li>
	    <li>Unlike previous conquering powers, the US was not capable of supporting long-term occupation forces to subdue conquered populations. The US lacked the administrative organization and the inclination to do this. In the cases when the US leadership forgot this, and kept US forces on the ground too long, the results were disastrous.</li>
	    <li>Further colonialist expansion was not possible, as there was no place left to expand into. Economic growth had to be based on international trade instead of imperialistic expansion into formerly-closed markets. All markets were now open, anyway.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Based on its own strengths and weaknesses, the economically-dominant US crafted a new financial world order. They called a summit meeting at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944 that included 730 delegates of 44 nations. At that time, the US could have dictated anything to the rest of the world. No one was in a strong enough position to oppose them. Many of the delegates were surprised at the US proposal. 
</p>
<p>
	They opened the US market to international trade on terms favorable to everyone else. They basically agreed to purchase everything the other countries could produce, without making any particular demands. They offered financial assistance to rebuild destroyed countries. They established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which later became the World Bank. They established a fixed currency exchange rate based on the gold standard (that bit did not last long, but created stability for a few years, which was sorely needed).
</p>
<p>
	Zeihan has a very positive view of the Bretton Woods Agreement. The <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/bretton-woods-agreement/">Corporate Finance Institute</a> continues the story, including the collapse of the gold standard in the 1960s-70s. Even so, some of the more-successful modern nations built their economies on this system, and to this day they are fully dependent on the structure of international alliances that arose from it. Even some of the US opponents in the war, notably Japan and Germany, were able to build strong economies mainly because they did not have to provide for their own defense; they were able to invest funds that would normally go toward defense into economic development. 
</p>
<p>
	Instead of occupation forces that would be opposed by the people, US military presence in many other countries was welcomed. The US was helping them rebuild. It was not for altruistic reasons, but the assistance was quite real.
</p>
<p>
	At any rate, the system that resulted from Bretton Woods became the basis for the US to become the single dominant economic force in the world. The system of alliances that emerged from World War II has been gradually deteriorating for some time now. The US strategy of quick interventions in other countries to enforce US economic hegemony is not working well anymore. From time to time, the US has engaged in the sort of long-term occupation for which it is ill-suited - Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq - at great cost. We call these misadventures "big mistakes." Other actors have found ways around the Bretton Woods system, such as OPEC and BRIC alliances. Changes are needed, if America is to maintain its dominant global economic position. 
</p>
<p>
	The State's approach to foreign policy takes advantage of the dominant position of the US and shifts international relations into a mode we believe is more appropriate for the coming century. Yet we are aware of the fact the US is in this position today because of policies we now consider obsolete and harmful. We would not be in as strong a position today had history taken a different course. The American State would build on that foundation, even while using different policies and approaches to maintain its influence and sovereignty. We do not propose to give up that influence.
</p>

<h4>5.2.2. American Military Tradition</h4>

<p>
	On first reading, it may seem strange to see us praising US military tradition. After all, our philosophy is soundly based on human rights, stability, prosperity, and peace. We have been clear in stating our intention to end the era of imperialism and colonialism. You may wonder how American military tradition supports the quite different approach of the American State.
</p>
<p>
	Foreigners might read the phrase "American military tradition" and recall atrocities like the burning of villages (e.g., Vietnam), or questionable operations like sneak attacks on meetings of tribal elders (e.g., Somalia), or the strafing and bombing of wedding celebrations (e.g., Afghanistan). From their perspective, those things might be the only examples of US military action they have seen.
</p>
<p>
	Operations like those were carried out under orders from the US leadership during the imperialist/colonialist era. The true leaders of the US are the cabal of politicians and industrialists whom we call the "power elite," and not necessarily the elected representatives of the people (or not all of them, anyway). When they want to carry out actions like those, they do not tell the military to burn villages or strafe wedding parties. They tell the military they have credible intelligence that terrorist operatives are present at the target. American military tradition is not about killing civilians. If they knew, they would refuse the orders, as their oath of service requires them to do.
</p>
<p>
	Many returning soldiers spoke out against these actions. Soldiers returning from the "big mistakes" are particularly well-known for speaking out against wars of aggression whose only purpose was to enrich the power elite. We Americans have been raised to believe our country represents values of freedom and democracy; when our government betrays those values, we are hurt and angered. No, that is not what we mean by "tradition."
</p>
<p>
	American military tradition is based on personal honor, respect for the Constitution, excellence in performance, loyalty, and sacrifice. Today's US military is an all-volunteer force. That translates into high morale and deep commitment. Compare these characteristics with almost any other military force in the world, and you will see why we consider American military tradition to be a strength, and not a weakness. 
</p>
<p>
    Conventional political thinking in the past few decades suggests that those who favor an end to imperialism and wars of aggression as tools of foreign policy also assume this would mean a dramatic reduction in military spending. This is not the case. To meet the goal of fully independent defense capability, the American State will need a sizeable, advanced, and motivated military. Our policies will change for the better, but we will still be standing on a planet populated by the enemies previous US foreign policy has created, and by other countries who wish to take a position of global dominance, to the detriment of our own independence and freedom. Our goal is to be able to defend ourselves against any and all aggressors without any outside assistance. 
</p>

<a name="defensevulnerabilities"/>
<h3>5.3. Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>
	These are a few obvious vulnerabilities in the Defense Pillar. Note that "defense" does not only involve the military. Having domestic production capability for certain critical technologies is also a defense matter. Dealing with domestic actors who use propaganda to divide the people against each other is also a defense matter. 
</p>
<p>
	Some characteristics of the US have made it possible for the country to make big mistakes and to operate in a highly inefficient and thoughtless way without suffering any lasting or crippling damage. Its geographical isolation, its qualitatively-unique wealth-generating domestic economy, and its sheer size are the main factors that have enabled this. 
</p>
<p>
	But, just as the particular strengths of a person or organization are often their Achilles' heel when taken beyond the point of diminishing returns, these same characteristics represent vulnerabilities in America's Defense Pillar. 
</p>

<h4>5.3.1. Strategic Mistakes</h4> 

<p>
	We cannot afford another "big mistake" in the nature of Vietnam or Afghanistan, constantly creating new enemies and new threats that pop up unexpectedly from every part of the globe. America is big, wealthy, and resilient - but not infinitely so. It is time to be more mindful of the consequences of our actions in the international arena.
</p>
<p>
	We must recognize and emphasize our strengths. With respect to military power, our strengths lie in the ability to project power quickly to any theater, and to hit hard. We do <em>not</em> have good capabilities with respect to long-term engagement on foreign soil, or maintaining an occupation force. Our strategies and tactics should be based on our strengths, not our weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
	An instance of a mistake is not, in itself, an ongoing vulnerability; especially if the mistake can be turned into a learning opportunity. However, the history of repeated engagements along the lines of Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan tells us the vulnerability lies in the mentality or attitude of US leaders. Without positive changes, this mentality is likely to lead to the ruin of the country.
</p>


<h4>5.3.2. Irrational Defense Contracting Procedures</h4>

<p>
	We have seen how the assumption that no one can reach us in our well-isolated land, and that questionable business practices will not have any long-term detrimental effects because the economy can absorb "anything," and the tendency for leaders to eat the first marshmallow every single time, have led to vulnerabilities in the Food and Energy Pillars, as well as careless infrastructure management and needless exposure to cyberattack. Politicians play games pitting their party against the other party, with no thought to the damage their legislation (or lack of action) may do to the country and the people. 
</p>
<p>
	The same attitudes and assumptions plague the Defense Pillar, as well. To the power elite, it must seem as if they can "get away with" literally anything, and the US will remain standing and remain strong. This is a foolish assumption.
</p>
<p>
	We cannot afford to throw defense contracts at our Ivy League school buddies with a nudge and a wink, unless we will seriously require them to deliver systems that actually work and are cost-effective, and do not require 20 or 30 years to develop and deploy, after endless cost and schedule overruns. 
</p>
<p>
	In the present era, technology changes rapidly. We need the capability to update our defensive capabilities, both military and civilian, both private-sector and public-sector, as close to <em>immediately</em> as possible when new technological innovations occur. The whole process of issuing requests for proposals (RFPs) and assessing the responses must be streamlined and de-politicized. 
</p>
<p>
	In the present-day US, there is an effort to separate public-sector and private-sector activities - even if much of that separation is fake, in view of the structure of the power elite. The effort to keep them separated, or to present the illusion that they are separated, slows down and overcomplicates defense-related initiatives. 
</p>
<p>
	In contrast, in an authoritarian country like China, cooperation between the government and private-sector companies happens whenever the leadership determines such cooperation is in the national interest. 
</p>
<p>
	The State is a hybrid authoritarian-democratic system. We believe it can provide meaningful and beneficial separation between the public and private sectors when that is desirable, and seamless coordination between the sectors when that is necessary. 
</p>


<h4>5.3.2. Lack of Independent Critical Manufacturing Capability</h4>

<p>
	A truly independent defensive capability requires the country to be self-sufficient in the manufacture of weapons systems, including exotic raw materials we currently import from abroad, and key high-tech components such as microchips for which the US presently depends on foreign suppliers.
</p>
<p>
	The State would encourage private sector innovators to discover alternatives to weapon systems that rely on materials that cannot be sourced domestically, but that can perform the same military functions as those weapons.
</p>

<h4>5.3.3. Vulnerability to Kinetic (Physical) Attack</h4>
<p>
	Possibly the first thing that comes to mind when we think about "defense" is defense against military attack. While the military is not the only component of the Defense Pillar, it is definitely central. 
</p>
<p>
	The category of kinetic or physical attacks includes a wide range of threats that call for different defensive capabilities. A physical attack may include anything from a small-scale terrorist bomb to a fleet of missiles carrying nuclear warheads. Some of these threats may be handled by civilian law enforcement operations, but large-scale and intensive attack by a foreign power must be handled by the military. 
</p>
<p>
	Due to the unique geography of the American mainland, a large-scale conventional assault or invasion/occupation force is unlikely to make much headway. But complacency based on favorable geography has been the downfall of nations, kingdoms, and empires throughout history. "No one will be able to cross the desert (or the sea, or the mountains); we need no defenses for attacks from that direction." And one day, someone comes. 
</p>
<p>
	The desert/sea/mountains today are the upper atmosphere and near-Earth space. Our geography affords no physical protection at all from attacks that use those avenues of approach. We are completely open to weapons launched from orbital platforms, submarine-launched cruise missiles, long-distance hypersonic missiles, and high-flying ballistic missiles. We are completely unprotected from electromagnetic pulse devices. We have no defense against Russia's Poseidon autonomous nuclear torpedo, whose 100-megaton warhead is meant to create a tsunami to wipe out coastal cities. 
</p>

<h4>5.3.4. Vulnerability to EMP Attacks</h4>

<p>
	An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or transient electromagnetic disturbance (TED) is a brief burst of electromagnetic energy that can disrupt communications and/or damage electronic circuitry. The effect occurs in nature, mainly in lightning. 
</p>
<p>
	An EMP behaves both as a wave and as particles. Its wave behavior consists of a sharp wave front followed by two slightly slower effects that follow the initial front. The wave front "zaps" electronic equipment. This is followed by a less powerful, shorter-range, and longer-duration effect that can amplify the damage from the wave front. The effects of this component are similar to those of lightning. This is followed by a lower-energy and longer-duration pulse that flows through electrical transmission lines and damages the power grid, sometimes even fusing transmission lines so they no longer function, thus complicating repairs. This component also damages any equipment connected to the transmission lines.
</p>
<p>
	Apart from natural causes, EMP is one of the effects of a thermonuclear detonation. One tactic an attacker may use against America is to detonate one or two nuclear warheads at a certain altitude above the target country. Any unprotected electronic circuits exposed to the effect would become non-functional.
</p>
<p>
	A nuclear warhead is a pretty expensive way to generate an EMP, and has obvious downsides due to its general destructive force and residual radiation. China and probably others are developing EMP weapons that do not rely on a nuclear warhead to produce the effect. This category of weapon is already a reality. China Electronics Technology Group (CETG) carried out a field test in 2021 in which they used an EMP weapon on the ground to shoot down a target aircraft flying at an altitude of 4,920 feet. The weapon uses a focused microwave beam to carry the charged particles, giving it longer range and more-precise targeting capability than an EMP generated by a nuclear weapon. 
</p>
<p>
	America has literally no defenses at all against this type of weapon, and no way to mitigate the effects of an EMP attack. 
</p>


<h4>5.3.5. Vulnerability to Cyberattack</h4>

<p>
	The present-day US engages in counterintelligence and proactive cyberdefense to an extent. However, the country remains wide open to cyberattacks of all kinds. We observe that the cause of nearly all this vulnerability is the same as the cause of most other weaknesses in the US - people tend to be careless and to assume their work and personal activities carry low risks. Most intrusions into corporate networks occur because a bad actor obtains the credentials of an authorized user. Most identity theft occurs because a person left private information in an insecure place, or responded to a phishing attack or simply a phone call in which the caller misrepresents themselves as a bank or a government agency. Much of this boils down to (a) education and (b) habit.
</p>
<p>
	We observe that one of the factors leading to people's complacency about "social" cyber attacks, in which the bad actor convinces the victim to give away private information - is habituation. In the present-day US, people are inundated with marketing promotions, advertisements, pleas for donations, political outreach, and other forms of annoyance constantly, day in and day out. Email inboxes, voice mail systems, text messages, and snail mail consist almost entirely of unsolicited attempts to sell things to people. It is a normal human reaction to become numb to all the interruptions. 
</p>
<p>
	Another factor that exacerbates the problem is the way passwords are used. Although there are now alternatives to passwords that are deemed more secure, most systems still use passwords. Although studies have shown that the only characteristic of a password that actually improves security is length, nearly all systems require users to devise cryptic and hard-to-remember passwords, and most systems limit passwords to a length that is easy for automated algorithms to break. People cannot remember 10 or 15 or more different, cryptic passwords; so they write them down or they use password-management software that then becomes the single point of entry for hackers to find the passwords. The misguided attempt to increase security by requiring crazy passwords results in reduced security. 
</p>
<p>
	Some social hackers are adept at presenting themselves in a credible way as a person's bank, insurance company, or even the IRS - although the IRS never communicates with taxpayers in any way other than snail mail. People fall for it. Even an educated and aware individual may fall for one out of 20 or 30 different kinds of attempts, when they are flooded with messages from every communication medium all day long, while they are trying to concentrate on their work and their lives. 
</p>
<p>
	Despite the wealth of information available and the active efforts of private and public sector entities to advise, train, and remind people of how cyberattacks and information theft can happen, almost no Americans practice common-sense avoidance of cyberattacks. Hardening systems and using software to monitor network activity are better than nothing, but they will always lag behind the new techniques hackers develop. Hackers are sophisticated, organized, highly skilled, and well-funded; and their full-time job is to find ways to break into systems. No one in a private sector company has the full-time job to counter this activity; at least, not at the same level of intensity as the bad actors. Government and military anti-hacking teams lack the time or manpower to detect every attempted break-in of public-sector and private-sector systems. 
</p>

<h4>5.3.6. Vulnerability to Stochastic Terrorism</h4>

<p>
	At the time of writing, in mid-2022, the term <em>stochastic terrorism</em> has become commonly used to describe a style of propaganda frequently used in the Republican Party's Strategic Communication Program (StratCom) and in the rhetoric of so-called "right-wing" broadcasters, Internet personalities, and television news media outlets. As of 27 July 2022, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/stochastic-terrorism">Dictionary.com</a> defines <em>stochastic terrorism</em> as:
</p>
<p class="indent">
the public demonization of a person or group resulting in the incitement of a violent act, which is statistically probable but whose specifics cannot be predicted:
<br/>
<em>The lone-wolf attack was apparently influenced by the rhetoric of stochastic terrorism.</em>
</p>
<p>
	Present-day US law does not protect the public against this kind of action. That is convenient for the power elite, as they can use the technique to divide Americans against each other for questionable reasons, and keep the public preoccupied with meaningless and largely false differences so that the people have little time or mental energy left over to recognize and counter the actions of the power elite to maintain their dominance. 
</p>
<p>
	The most relevant statute in present-day US law is <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section373&num=0&edition=prelim">18 USC 373: Solicitation to commit a crime of violence</a>. It reads:

<p class="indent">
	(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against property or against the person of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavors to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years.

	(b) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defense at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

</p>
<p>
	That is a good law, but it has a loophole that allows stochastic terrorism - the perpetrator must attempt to influence a specific individual to carry out a specific act of violence against a specific target. 
</p>
<p>
	The reason we consider stochastic terrorism to be a Category 1 offense is that it has, in fact, been used in the US to lay the groundwork for an attempted violent overthrow of democracy on January 6, 2021. General rhetoric of this kind has also been cited as the inspiration for violent acts, when the perpetrators were arrested and interviewed by law enforcement. 
</p>
<p>
	At a time of high tension between the US and Russia (during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022), Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson's program was repeated on Russian state television quite frequently, because the rhetoric undermined the unity and stability of the United States. Carlson never asked any specific person to carry out any specific act against any specific target. He always included the disclaimer, "I'm just asking questions."
</p>
<p>
	Stochastic terrorism is not a theoretical problem; it is currently in use in the US and is having the intended effects. Stochastic terrorism has the potential to unravel the fabric of American society and to destroy the United States from within. The State must have protections against this form of attack. 
</p>


<h4>5.3.7. Vulnerability to Actions that Undermine the Three Pillars of Independence</h4>

<p>
	Possibly arising from the assumption that the US can absorb literally anything, which leads many government and business leaders to act carelessly and without much thought to potential negative consequences, many business activities harm Americans or the US nation-state in some way. We do not believe business leaders <em>intend</em> to damage or destroy the very country that enables their success. Instead, we think they simply do not consider the possibility that the country could fail. It comes back to the Marshmallow Experiment - American business leaders always eat the first marshmallow. They do not seem to care what might happen next.
</p>
<p>
	In some cases, business leaders do not understand the fact the country enables and supports their ability to create and build their companies. For instance, a catch-phrase at Facebook over the years has been, "Company over country." It is as if they think their company is larger, stronger, more stable, and more valuable than their country. This misconception seems to be characteristic of a younger generation of business leaders, who came up with a good idea at just the right time, but who are generally uneducated and arrogant. For example, Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook while a student at Harvard University; he dropped out of school in his sophomore year to build on the initial success of Facebook, which was based on a settlement in a lawsuit against him that accused him of stealing other people's ideas to create Facebook. 
</p>
<p>
	While "old money" like the Rockefellers and the Morgans represent the power elite of the US, this younger generation of entrepreneurs represents a category of business leaders who are focused solely on maximizing profit and who would happily scuttle the United States for an extra dollar. On the whole, they are neither educated nor ethical. It does not occur to them to ask what would become of their companies should they succeed in destroying the United States. The State's legal system would offer protection to the country and the people against this.
</p>
<p>
	Whether old money or new, many business leaders act to maximize their personal wealth in the short term regardless of the consequences to the country or its people. This is a vulnerability that threatens the sustainable freedom of the American people.

<h3>5.4. Possible Strategies</h3>

<p>
	These are a few possible strategies to support the Defense Pillar, building on our strengths and the positive attributes of the current system, and working to correct or minimize the risks from the negative attributes of the current system. 
</p>

<h4>5.4.1. Avoid Strategic Mistakes</h4>

<p>
	We consider some of the past actions of the US to have been strategic mistakes. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that US government administrations have learned from past mistakes, as they tend to repeat the same actions. 
</p>
<p>
	In the category of strategic mistakes we include actions such as the conquest of the Phillippines (1898-1901); the US intervention in the early Soviet Union (1918-1920); the six-month occupation of Veracruz, Mexico (1914); a series of interventions in Cuba, Honduras, Panama, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua (1915-1935); the Korean Conflict (1950-present, cease-fire in effect since 1953); the Vietnam War (1965-1973); intervention and occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan (2001-2020).
</p>
<p>
	It is possible the US power elite does not see these actions as "mistakes" at all. If that is true, then naturally they will not adjust their strategies based on the costs and outcomes of these actions. They may simply try to "do the wrong thing righter." If we examine behavior rather than rhetoric, that explanation seems credible.
</p>
<p>
	Critics of the US may complain that our list omits many other military interventions, assassinations, so-called "extraordinary renditions," and political and economic interference in many other countries on many other occasions. That complaint holds water from a moral point of view, but here we are concerned with strategic errors. A strategic error is a military action that fails to achieve its goals while incurring great costs for the US, in money, in blood, and in reputation.
</p>
<p>
	US military forces are at their best for rapid deployment, quick suppression of enemy assets and forces, and timely withdrawal. Military interventions based on those strengths have generally succeeded in achieving the US government's objectives for the operations (setting aside moral concerns and looking at what "works" or "doesn't work"). 
</p>
<p>
	US military forces are not organized or trained to support long-term occupation of hostile territory, suppressing steady and determined grassroots opposition over a period of months or years. When the US has attempted to do that, the operations have always resulted in tremendous loss of life and extensive economic and physical damage to the other country, as well as damage to the morale of US forces and the American civilian population. 
</p>
<p>
	Note that the US military bases in place around the world under the Bretton Woods systems are not "occupation forces." The military does not override the local civilian government of the host country, and they need not suppress popular opposition to their presence. They are guests. We are talking about wars of aggression and forcible occupations of countries where US forces are unwelcome.
</p>
<p>
	We consider these actions mistakes because they did not further the economic or political goals of the US, did not improve quality of life for Americans, and did not result in improved international stability. The numerous interventions in the name of halting the spread of communism turned out to be largely pointless in the end; either communism won out anyway, despite our efforts; or the resulting regimes proved to be less horrific than feared, and less horrific than the rightist dictatorships they replaced. 
</p>
<p>
	When the US invaded and occupied countries to control their resources for the benefit of the private-sector elite, the resulting economic systems in those countries proved to be less useful and less valuable to US interests than stable, prosperous trade partners would have been. In the process of failing, failing, and failing again, the US expended massive amounts of money and lost many thousands of young lives, as well as slaughtering civilians in untold numbers - possibly numbering in the tens of millions in all. 
</p>
<p>
	The fact the US has survived all these mistakes and still maintains a strong economic and political position in the world testifies to the fact a very large and well-isolated country with a strong domestic economy can rebound from problems that would destroy most others. It does not, however, mean we can continue to operate in the same way indefinitely without repercussions. 
</p>
<p>
	In the post-imperialist and post-colonialist world, we must use the military judiciously, as a coordinated part of foreign policy, and in ways that maximize its strengths and avoid depending on its weaknesses. Given the economic power of America in the 2020s, there is no need for us to bend others to our will by brute force. Some countries may choose not to do business with us; this will hardly affect our economic strength at all, and will likely be a temporary decision, soon to be reversed as the benefits of trade become obvious to the other party. 
</p>
<p>
	There is no need to use force to "open markets," as the US did in the 19th and early 20th century. Markets are open. Everyone wants to trade. Nor does it matter if some trading partners have very different political systems than our own; trade is trade, and the State's responsibility is for the American people, not the world. We gain nothing when we expend blood and treasure to try and reshape every other country in our own image. 
</p>
<p>
	Foreign countries have been demanding for decades that the US cease interference in their internal affairs. The State will honor that wish and do business with whomever is in charge in each country, unless the American people cannot live with themselves for supporting brutal dictatorships, and choose to take their business elsewhere. Given true independence in food, energy, and defense, the American people will always have that option. And that brings us to the State's approach to influencing other countries to improve human rights - we will make it highly desirable to become a trading partner with America. Brute force is simply not necessary.
</p>
<p>
	President Theodore Roosevelt famously said, "Speak softly and carry a big stick - you will go far." We consider this sound advice. When we spend the day whacking everyone with our big stick, without bothering to speak softly or loudly, all we end up with is a queue of enemies waiting for their turn to do us harm. This certainly does not further our goal to enable Americans to live in freedom without external interference. That pattern is an example of a <em>reinforcing loop</em>, in Systems Thinking terms. The more we do it, the worse things get.
</p>

<h4>5.4.2. Rationalize Defense Contracting</h4>

<p>
	Defense contracting procedures are not the most urgent or serious problem for the Defense Pillar. However, there is room for improvement. Two opportunities stand out for us. First, the current process is long and cumbersome, and almost always results in significant budget and schedule overruns. Second, the current process is a "good old boy" network in which privileged contractors and senior military and government leaders "collude" (in effect, even if not technically) to ensure the same members of the power elite receive the lion's share of profit from all defense contracts.
</p>

<h4>5.4.2.1. Improve Relevance and Efficiency of the Process</h4>

<p>
	Eventually, at great cost, defense contractors have been able to supply the US military with highly effective and reliable weapons systems and other equipment. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then the performance of the US military over the decades certainly demonstrates this. The problem is the "eventually, at great cost" part of the equation. 
</p>
<p>
	The contemporary world moves at a faster pace than the world of the Cold War era. Alliances shift rapidly, foreign weapons development leapfrogs our capabilities, hostile actors large and small pose varying threats, sometimes independently and sometimes acting in concert. A military built to defend against a head-to-head large-scale war with a large adversary cannot cope with hit-and-run tactics by a non-governmental organization that can evaporate into the civilian background in a split second. 
</p>
<p>
	We simply cannot wait 20 years or longer for new systems to come online. Our military must be flexible and adaptable. Defense contractors must be able to keep up with that demand. The RFP process must be efficient enough to support this requirement.
</p>

<h4>5.4.2.2. Focus on America's Needs</h4>

<p>
	There is a long history of defense contracts going over budget by a factor of ten, yet military and government leaders continue to accept the lowest bid. How many times must a problem repeat itself before people begin to understand it is a predictable pattern? 
</p>
<p>
	We think the answer is approximately three times. (No, it was not a rhetorical question.) After that, no one can pretend they did not know the cost and schedule overruns would occur. Therefore, they must be repeating the same process intentionally. Why would they do so? Because their goals are not limited to the needs of the country. They have some other goal.
</p>
<p>
	Clearly, defense contractors are not entirely ignoring the needs of the country. After all, eventually, and at great cost, they deliver <em>something</em> rather than <em>nothing</em> in most cases. 
</p>
<p>
	There is an old saying that every system is perfectly designed to produce the outcomes that it produces. The outcomes of defense contracting are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>80% - generating almost unimaginable personal wealth for a select few members of the power elite, and </li>
		<li>20% - providing solutions for the nation's defense needs.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Under the State system, we propose to adjust the RFP process so that it becomes perfectly designed to produce the following outcome:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>100% - providing solutions for the nation's defense needs.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	To do otherwise would be a Category 1 offense, as it would undermine the Defense Pillar.
</p>

<h4>5.4.3. Secure Domestic Sources of Critical Materials</h4>

<p>
	The "six strategic metals" used in the manufacture of weapons systems and other military equipment are magnesium, titanium, rhenium, tungsten, molybdenum, and uranium. 
</p>

<h4>5.4.3.1. Magnesium</h4>

<p>
	Magnesium is a so-called "strategic metal," used in advanced weapons systems (as well as in food, supplements, and other applications). According to the <a href="https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/magnesium/reporter/usa?redirect=true">Observatory of Economic Complexity</a> (OEC), in 2020 the US imported a total of $250 million worth of magnesium while exporting $81.3 million. It is not obvious to us why some countries are both sources and recipients of magnesium; for instance, the US imported $39 million of magnesium from China while exporting $3.27 million, and imported $26.7 million from Canada while exporting $32.6 million - almost the same amount going out as coming in. We need to ensure the entire supply of magnesium that goes to military applications is sourced domestically.
</p>

<h4>5.4.3.2. Titanium</h4>

<p>
	Titanium is another strategic metal, vital in certain advanced weapons systems. The US in 2020 was both the world's #1 exporter and the world's #1 importer of titanium. Were we to learn more about the rationale for this, we might conclude it is necessary and/or beneficial for America. But on the surface, it appears to be movement for movement's sake. Clearly, America has the titanium resources necessary to provide for the needs of the Defense Pillar.
</p>

<h4>5.4.3.3. Rhenium</h4>

<p>
	Rhenium is a strategic metal used in the manufacture of aviation engines; for high-temperature coatings on rockets and missiles; for other high-temperature applications such as thermal shielding, arc discharge, and electrical equipment; and for spacecraft instrumentation. 
</p>
<p>
	Based on reports by the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/rhenium-statistics-and-information">United States Geological Survey</a>, the US had a net import reliance for rhenium as a percentage of consumption of 72% in 2021, continuing a downward trend since 2017. The main sources of imports are Chile, Canada, Japan, and Kazakhstan, of which all but the last are probably reliable partners. The US has no stockpile of rhenium. 
</p>
<p>
	It is not realistic to cause more rhenium to appear in America. Therefore, the State's approach will be to reduce overal import reliance where feasible, and to engage our primary trade partners and our "neighborhood" as import sources to the maximum extent possible.
</p>
<p>
	Everything here is a point-in-time conjecture as of mid-2022, and is subject to change. As of that time, tensions between the US and Russia are rising. Russia has withdrawn from the International Space Station program, and is pushing back against NATO assistance to Ukraine. Kazakhstan may or may not agree with Russia philosophically, but they are well within Russia's orbit geographically, politically, and economically, and with some 3 million Slavic inhabitants and thousands of mixed families, culturally as well. The State would consider increasing imports from Kazakhstan to begin building a domestic stockpile of rhenium, while our positive trade relationship lasts. This would have the secondary benefit of diverting some of Russia's supply, at least temporarily. 
</p>

<h4>5.4.3.4. Tungsten</h4>

<p>
	Tungsten is used to produce various alloys, primarily cemented carbides (hardmetals). It is valued for its hardness - its nickname is "industrial tooth" - and heat resistance. According to the USGS, the US' net import reliance as a percentage of consumption is over 50 percent, holding steady for several years. The US government stockpile of tungsten is being used (reduced). According to OEC, the US is the world's #1 importer of tungsten and its #3 exporter.  
</p>
<p>
	Tungsten strengthens blades used for cutting hard materials in the metalworking, mining, and oil and gas drilling industries. It is also used to make electronic components and wiring, and equipment for heating, welding, and lighting. 
</p>

<h4>5.4.3.5. Molybdenum</h4>

<p>
	Molybdenum is used to produce alloys that require high strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion. The US imports and exports molybdenum in the forms of ferromolybdenum and molybdic oxide. Most sources of imports are from countries in Category 4, the Americas, as well as South Korea. China is another source of imports. 
</p>
<p>
	There does not appear to be an issue with the supply of molybdenum.
</p>

<h4>5.4.3.6. Uranium</h4>

<p>
	We have considered the sourcing of uranium and the disposal of nuclear waste under the heading of the Energy Pillar, but uranium also has two important military uses. Many ships in the US Navy are nuclear-powered, and their reactors require plutonium, made from U-238, for fuel. Highly-enriched uranium U-235 is used in nuclear weapons. According to a <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1050/uranium.htm">USGS report</a> dating from 2004, about 99.25% of naturally-occurring uranium is U-238, and only about 0.75% is U-235. 
</p>
<p>
	One function of the USGS is to maintain the US national list of critical minerals. In 2021, the organization published a draft update to the list that excluded uranium and rhenium. The list is available on the Federal Register at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/09/2021-24488/2021-draft-list-of-critical-minerals">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/09/2021-24488/2021-draft-list-of-critical-minerals</a>. The rationale for removing uranium from the list was that it is a type of fuel. The Energy Act of 2020 explicitly excluded minerals related to fuel from the list of critical minerals.
</p>
<p>
	The position of the State on critical minerals and any other materials or supplies is that whatever is relevant to maintaining the independence of America is "critical," whether its primary purpose is as a fuel or anything else. 
</p>
<p>
	In the case of uranium, the State would pursue alternatives to nuclear power for naval vessels. Any alternative would have to provide at least the same capabilities as nuclear power. In addition, we would pursue alternatives to nuclear weapons. It is unclear at this time what alternatives are technically and economically feasible. One possibility is antimatter, but the technology is not well developed at this time. We would continue to support the existing solutions for ship power and high-impact weapons until practical alternatives have been identified and developed.
</p>

<h4>5.4.4. Develop Critical Manufacturing Capability</h4>

<p>
	One of the most worrisome vulnerabilities for defense under the present-day US system is the fact nearly all microchip manufacturing is done outside the US. The country is entirely dependent on imports for this category of product.
</p>
<p>
	The State would take steps to encourage and facilitate the development of domestic manufacturing capability for microchips and all other electronic devices and components relevant to the sustainable independence of America.
</p>

<h4>5.4.5. Layered Strategy Against Kinetic (Physical) Attack</h4>
<p>
	By definition, our defensive capability must meet the goal to "prevent, forestall, reduce the risk of, mitigate the effects of, and punish or eliminate anyone and anything that threatens" the sustainable freedom of Americans. It seems likely this will require a broad range of capabilities as well as coordination among different military branches and between military and civilian authorities. 
</p>

<h5>5.4.5.1. Prevention</h5>

<p>
	Prevention is the most effective solution. It halts the threat very early and at low cost, compared with the cost of war. What does it mean to "prevent" a large-scale nuclear attack? Basically, it means any action that results in the enemy not launching their weapons, whether by encouraging them not to make that decision, or by denying them the capability to act on the decision. To that end, the State would develop multiple layers of defensive capability. 
</p>
<p>
	The first layer is foreign relations. If a potentially-hostile country becomes dependent on us economically, especially for basic needs such as food, this will reduce the likelihood they will choose to attack us. If we build cultural connections with another country, they will be less interested in harming us. 
</p>
<p>
	According to our <a href="bg-international.html">categorization of foreign countries</a>, a country openly Hostile towards America can become an existential threats to America, or can move in the other direction and become a neutral country with an Unfavorable View of America. Our strategy for international relations would be to encourage hostile countries to become at least <em>neutral</em>, even if they maintain an unfavorable view of America. This is a better outcome for both America and the other country.
</p>
<p>
	The second layer, still pertaining to prevention, is intelligence. If we can anticipate a potential enemy's decision to launch an attack, we can take action before the attack is launched to disable (or at least, reduce) their capability. In the Cold War era, people used the term "pre-emptive first strike" to describe this tactic. 
</p>
<p>
	"Pre-emptive first strike" does not mean an all-out nuclear attack against the other country. The term can also refer to a pre-emptive attack against specific targets, with the goal of reducing the enemy's capability to launch a crippling attack against America. 
</p>
<p>
	For example, should active hostilities arise between America and Russia we could have a pre-planned operation ready to go to eliminate all five of their Borei-class nuclear missile submarines simultaneously. Our military tracks the locations of all Russian ships, and we know where to find the targets. That is only an example; of course, that action would be coordinated with other operations to reduce their offensive capability before they initiated their general attack. Unfortunately, there is no practical way to eliminate their offensive capability altogether.
</p>
<p>
	We have an advantage with respect to Russia in that each class of submarine in their fleet is serviced by a single port. Eliminating one port will reduce the effectiveness of that entire class of ships; not instantaneously, but the ships would steadily lose effectiveness throughout the war, as they could not be repaired or resupplied except at sea. Of course, these preemptive strikes would not entirely eliminate their ability to strike American territory, but they would reduce the potential damage from such an attack. 
</p>
<p>
	We use Russia as the example because it is the most potent potential enemy country as of the time of writing, and not because we are looking for trouble with Russia. We are not looking for trouble with anyone. We just want to be prepared for all contingencies. If we can deal with Russia, then we can deal with anyone else. In a sense, they are the benchmark for this sort of planning.
</p>

<h5>5.4.5.2. Delay</h5>

<p>
	When prevention is not possible, the next word in the list is <em>forestall</em>, meaning <em>delay</em> or <em>postpone</em>. This is essentially what the US did throughout the Cold War in the 20th century. The primary ways the US accomplished that were (a) economic aid and various discreet deals with the USSR, mostly not publicized, or described by both sides in flamboyantly-patriotic and factually-inaccurate terms; and (b) ensuring the Kremlin understood what would happen to Russia if they initiated a nuclear war with the West. The State would continue with these tactics. 
</p>

<h5>5.4.5.3. Risk Reduction and Damage Mitigation - Decentralization and Redundancy</h5>

<p>
	The idea of reducing the risk or mitigating the effects of an attack represents the third layer in the defensive strategy. The phrase "reduce the risk of" means to minimize the extent of the damage to a particular target. The phrase "mitigate the effects of" means to ensure the system as a whole continues to operate even when some of its components (i.e., individual targets) have been destroyed or damaged.
</p>
<p>
	To achieve these goals, we need <em>resiliency</em> - the ability to continue operating even when heavily damaged. The primary way to improve resiliency of the overall "system" (the whole country) is <em>decentralization</em>. No single critical capability can be centralized in one or a few locations, and the connections between components of the system must not be organized in a way that presents one or a few targets whose destruction would disable the network. 
</p>
<p>
	To continue with Russia as the example (only for discussion purposes, of course), to destroy America physically they would have to destroy more than 40 large metropolitan areas and hundreds of defense-related sites. In contrast, to destroy Russia physically would require the destruction of perhaps 6 or 7 significant targets; it is realistic to expect after the loss of 3 or 4 primary targets, they would cease hostilities. While such a war would result in significant and tragic losses on our side, America would survive and rebuild; Russia would not. And there are no other countries in the world that pose a threat on the same scale as Russia. 
</p>
<p>
	In the section about the Energy Pillar, we alluded to the general way in which large cities have emerged, and mentioned the difficulty in planning cities. The challenge for defense of each urban area is the physical concentration of people and facilities within a small footprint. The challenge at national scale is the location of critical capabilities in a single city, or just a couple of cities.
</p>
<p>
	Decentralization within the urban area can be accomplished (in principle) by spreading things around; changing from a central core with supporting infrastructure surrounding it, and residential development surrounding that in turn, into a series of smaller urban centers, each with its own self-contained facilities for business, industry, and living. On the larger scale, spreading critical capabilities across multiple cities separated by long distances improves decentralization and therefore resiliency. The country as a whole would still be operational following a large-scale nuclear attack. After our military response, the attacking country would probably not be operational. This is not something to wish for, but at least America would survive and could rebuild. 
</p>
<p>
	An example of a large urban area that is internally decentralized is the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex in northern Texas. Although we are not thinking of Texas as part of the new America due to its political and cultural values, that metropolitan area offers an example of what we mean by decentralization. Both Dallas and Ft. Worth have their historical downtown cores, but the area comprises a number of small "downtowns" separated from each other by several miles (in many cases, more than 10 miles). The whole thing is spread over an area about 100 miles across from east to west and about 30 miles north to south. 
</p>
<p>
	Everything is redundantly connected with modern transportation and communication infrastructure. Most large businesses that operate there are spread out in multiple business parks that are well separated. The population is spread more-or-less evenly across the whole area. Apart from the two airports, there are few individual targets where an attack could eliminate a key industrial or operational capability. Even the airports have remote backup sites - a number of military and civilian airports lie within a 10 to 15 minute flight of Dallas. 
</p>
<p>
	Deep inside friendly territory, the only practical way for an enemy force to reach this metropolitan area is by air. Using conventional weapons such as bombers and long-range artillery, it would take massive amounts of ammunition and quite a long time to disable the crtiical capabilities housed in the target area. Defensive forces would be able to eliminate the attackers before they could succeed in this.
</p>
<p>
	Using nuclear weapons, an enemy would need several warheads to take this asset completely out of commission, delivered with high precision and careful timing. By the time the inbound missiles were on final approach, military assets would have been distributed throughout the area and air defenses activated. A few missiles would penetrate; there is no magic, here. But the damage could be mitigated. It is not a realistic military objective, even for a nuclear power like Russia.
</p>
<p>
	American cities have not been planned with decentralization in mind explicitly, and certainly not for the purpose of national defense - or national survivability. Yet, many American cities are spread out over large geographical areas as compared with European cities. Apart from having many targets to strike, an enemy would have to concentrate a good deal of force on each of those targets in order to eliminate them. 
</p>
<p>
	Some of the older cities in the eastern US are more vulnerable, as they are compact and centralized, and in some cases geography has not allowed for expansion. The strategy of decentralization can still mitigate damage in that region at the larger scale, even if certain individual cities could be lost. 
</p>

<h5>5.4.5.4. Risk Reduction and Damage Mitigation - Resistance to EMP Attacks</h5>

<p>
	Standards for civilian and military electronic devices and for electrical transmission and storage equipment will include provisions for protection against EMP effects. In addition to the fields of engineering already involved in the design of such equipment, new standards will call for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) factors to be included in all new equipment, as well as retrofitted existing equipment, including civilian electrical and electronic systems and military assets. 
</p>
<p>
	The State will push for comprehensive upgrading of all existing equipment, beginning immediately. We anticipate this to be among the most expensive programs in the State's development of the Defense and Energy Pillars, because at the starting point there is practically nothing in place. 
</p>

<h5>5.4.5.5. Establish Credible Threat of Punishment or Annihilation</h5>

<p>
	The idea of <em>deterrence</em> was part of US defense strategy in the 20th century. In the Cold War, there was a concept of "Mutually Assured Destruction," or MAD, that stated if either the USSR or the US initiated a nuclear war, both countries would be destroyed. 
</p>

<p>
	The American State has a different philosophy regarding war. We will not tolerate any existential threats to America, as that would be contrary to the purpose of the State - ensuring sustainable independence and freedom for Americans. We have a "last resort" mentality regarding war - it will be the last (final) act of any agressor. 
</p>

<h4>5.4.5. Strengthen Cyber Defense Capability</h4>

<p>
	There are different sources of vulnerability to cyberattack, so the potential strategies must be multifaceted. The first line of defense is education. The State educational system includes general life skills and information about how to "navigate the system;" that is, how to carry out necessary tasks in life. In a high-tech world, understanding how to prevent information theft is a basic life skill. Knowledge about how to avoid risks of cyberattack on an individual level will be included in the core curriculum. Most companies and government agencies already provide periodic refreshers on this subject, and that will continue under the State system.
</p>
<p>
	Another aspect of education is to educate the general public that all companies are susceptible to this kind of attack. Currently, many companies keep attacks secret for fear their reputation will be damaged and customers will avoid doing business with them. We need to eliminate this stigma from our culture. A cyberattack is no different from a mugging on the street; it is not the victim's fault, even if one could argue that the victim did not practice situational awareness. 
</p>
<p>
	Beyond the stigma and reputational damage, another problem with secrecy is that each company is on its own in opposition to hacking organizations that are far more capable and sophisticated. By sharing information and cooperating in corrective actions, companies gain the benefit of everyone else's experience and resources.
</p>
<p>
	Establishing standards for cybersecurity is tricky, because the threat landscape is constantly changing. However, some basic things can be defined as a baseline for security. As mentioned under vulnerabilities in section 5.3.5, the use of passwords is a problem, and the way passwords are used makes the problem worse. We can at least establish a baseline standard that requires other methods of user authentication, known to be more effective than passwords, and we can require rational rules for password creation rather than special characters and numbers, etc. 
</p>
<p>
	Conceptually and practically, interfering in someone's life by stealing their identity or by stealing their account numbers prevents them from living their lives in freedom. Therefore, theft of personal information, publication of personal information ("doxxing"), and identity theft will be considered Category 1 offenses. Category 1 offenses can result in multi-decade prison terms. We hope this will serve as a deterrent, at least to <em>some</em> bad actors. History suggests most criminals do not pay attention to deterrents, but this can be one step among several to alleviate the problem.
</p>
<p>
	As a hybrid authoritarian-democratic system, the State can cooperate with private-sector organizations more closely than under the present-day US system. When a company detects an intrusion into their systems, they can call on the government to assist them in setting traps in the system, tracing the origin of the intrusion, collecting evidence against the offenders, and prosecuting them. The government will have teams whose sole purpose is to combat cyberattacks, while most private companies will not. It makes sense to protect American business by providing this service gratis.
</p>
<p>
	Legal remedies apply to domestic offenders only. Law enforcement's jurisdiction ends at America's borders. Therefore, when the perpetrators of information theft and other forms of cyberattacks are located in foreign countries, the problem becomes a matter of national defense. While we are aware this policy may set a dangerous precedent in international relations, we see no practical alternative than to define a cyberattack as equivalent to a kinetic attack. The State will assert the right to launch a physical response to cyberattacks originating outside America. 
</p>
<p>
	That said, when the attack originates in one of our primary trade partners, or a country in our "neighborhood," or a country with which America has an extradition agreement, the State will first attempt to engage law enforcement in the subject country, and cooperate with them to identify and arrest the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>
	Another change in the legal system will help protect individual Americans from excessive damage due to identity theft. In the present-day US, once someone obtains the physical or electronic credentials that enable them to pose as someone else, the victim has little legal recourse and may face many years of expense and inconvenience to rectify the situation. Under the State system, Citizens and Residents will be in a national database. They can identify themselves biometrically, by DNA, fingrerprints, eye scans, and other means. They can demonstrate their true identity even if various "numbers" have been stolen. Law enforcement will tend to believe the victim when they report the crime, rather than assuming whoever is holding a driver's license or credit card is the actual person. 
</p>

<h4>5.4.6. Guard Against Stochastic Terrorism</h4>

<p>
	The State will prohibit the same activities as 18 USC 373, and will also prohibit stochastic terrorism. Rhetoric intended to raise doubts in people's minds about any group of people legally present in America will be a Category 1 offense, even if the rhetoric does not ask anyone in particular to carry out any specific act of violence against a named target. 
</p>
<p>
	There is a balancing act here - at what point does Constitutionally-protected free speech move from the realm of dissent into the realm of stochastic terrorism? To an extent, it may always be a judgment call. However, there is a key difference that may be used to distinguish between dissent and stochastic terrorism. When someone expresses dissent, they focus on the particular policies or actions with which they disagree. When we hear, instead, a constant refrain of "us <em>versus</em> them," and it seems that "they" are responsible for all the ills of the world, then where is the "dissent?" Clearly, the intent of such speech is only to divide people against each other.
</p>
<p>
	A second indicator is the dehumanization of the "other." In the present-day US, supporters of the Republican Party frequently refer to supporters of the Democratic Party as "demon-rats," a play on "Democrats." Conversely, supporters of the Democratic Party refer to supporters of the Republican Party as "MAGAts" - a play on "maggots", referring to Donald Trump's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again (MAGA). 
</p>
<p>
	This is similar to Hutu references to Tutsi as "cockroaches" in the years leading up to the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, and the Chavistas' references to the Venezuelan middle class as "escu&aacute;lidos" in the ramp-up to the destruction of democracy in that country in the early years of the 21st century. We perceive the same pattern of rhetoric in the present-day US. It is not necessary to dehumanize anyone simply to express dissent with a policy or action. When dehumanization is part of the message, the message is not one of legitimate dissent.
</p>
<p>
	We believe it will be possible to distinguish between the two accurately, and to protect Americans' freedom of speech while also defending the country against stochastic terrorism.
</p> 

<h4>5.4.7. Enforce Laws Protecting the Three Pillars of Independence</h4>

<p>
	While many aspects of the State are similar to corresponding aspects of the present-day US, some aspects are very different indeed. The most obvious difference is the change from 50 states to a single government. The second most significant difference may be the concept of the Three Pillars of Independence. 
</p>
<p>
	There are certain things that are absolutely mandatory if Americans are to enjoy individual liberty over a long period of time. Essentially, those are independence in food, energy, and defense. Under the State system, any action that undermines those Three Pillars of Independence will be treated as a Category 1 offense. 
</p>
<p>
	Maintaining the Three Pillars of Independence is considered a matter of national defense; a matter of the survivability of the country. For example, actions such as moving American jobs overseas where cheap labor may be found, at the cost of degrading the American economy and the quality of life of Americans, is a Category 1 offense because it compromises Americans' ability to live in freedom according to their own values and principles without external interference. No such concept exists in the present-day US. It may take some time for business leaders to work out how they need to operate to stay within the law while still maintaining profitability. 
</p>
<p>
	The State will attempt to stabilize business behavior around the Three Pillars through a combination of education, outreach, and law enforcement.

<h3>5.5. Implications for Foreign Policy</h3>

<p>
	In the State system, the military leadership both informs and supports civilian decision-making at the National Council level. The foreign policy approach is to cultivate long-term relationships with whomever holds power in each foreign country. The strategy includes using our economic power to provide generous assistance, in part for humanitarian purposes, but also to strengthen ties with other governments and to foster international stability and prosperity, which are the foundation of lasting and meaningful peace - a precondition for our own sustainable independence and freedom.
</p>
<p>
	We group foreign countries according to a few simple criteria, such as whether they are geographical neighbors, whether they are stable nation-states, and whether they hold positive or negative views about America. We then take a specific approach to relations with countries belonging to each category. This is elaborated in the <a href="bg-international.html">Backgrounder on Internatonal Relations</a>. Of course, each country is different, and some are different enough to require a customized approach to foreign relations.
