	This Article defines the official names of the country, its people, and the people's political body, known as a <em>state</em>.
</p>

<a name="namecountry"/>
<h3>2.1. Country</h3>

<p>
	The country to which this Constitution applies is called "America."
</p>

<a name="namepeople"/>
<h3>2.2. People</h3>

<p>
	The people of America are called "Americans."
</p>

<a name="namestate"/>
<h3>2.3. State</h3>

<p>
	The political body of the American people, representing their shared fundamental values and their collective will, is called the "State" when the context is clearly America, or the "American State" when the context calls for clarification of which state is meant.
</p>

<a name="namegov"/>
<h3>2.4. Government</h3>

<p>
	The set of administrative functions and facilities that realize the will of the State is called the "Government." 
</p>

<a name="nameconstitution"/>
<h3>2.5. Constitution</h3>

<p>
	The formal name of this document is "The Constitution for America." Informally, it may be called "the American Constitution" or, when the context is clear, "the Constitution."
</p>



<a name="values"/>
<h2>Article 3. Values</h2>

<p>
These fundamental values are the basis of the State. They cannot be modified or replaced by any administrative procedure. Everything in this Constitution, in the Legal Code, in Regulations, and in rules established by quasi-governmental entities must be defensible in terms of one or more of these values.
</p>

<a name="valuehumanrights"/>
<h3>3.1. Human Rights</h3>

<p>
Basic <em>human rights</em> are considered to be part and parcel of one's humanity. Human rights, as enumerated in this Constitution, must never be violated. 
</p>

<a name="valuelegalrights"/>
<h3>3.2. Legal Rights</h3>

<p>
<em>Legal rights</em> define the minimum standard of civilized interaction between formal governmental entities and other persons. Legal rights, as enumerated in this Constitution, must never be violated.
</p>

<a name="valueindependence"/>
<h3>3.3. Sustainable Independence</h3> 

<p>
<em>Independence</em> means the ability of Americans to live according to their own values without dependencies on foreign governments or other external entities. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Sustainable</em> means "long-term" as opposed to "temporary" or "expedient." 
</p>
Three broad areas of economic activity and supporting infrastructure are key to establishing independence and maintaining it over time. These are known as <em>The Three Pillars of Independence</em> or, informally, <em>The Three Pillars</em> or <em>The Pillars</em>. All decisions and actions of Government will be, at a minimum, consistent with sustainable independence, and may be directly supportive of it. Any action that undermines independence in any of these areas will be unlawful.
</p>
<p>
For purposes of law, formal State actions, and adjudication of court cases, the Three Pillars of Independence take precedence over individual liberty. The rationale is that the Three Pillars provide the structure within which sustainable individual liberty is possible. To damage any of the Three Pillars is to contribute to the end of individual liberty for all Americans. No one's personal freedom includes the right to destroy freedom for everyone else.
</p>

<a name="pillarfood"/>
<h4>3.3.1. Food Pillar: Independence in Food Production, Quality, and Distribution</h4>

<p>
The country must have the capability, on a sustainable basis, to provide sufficient basic food for all Americans, of high quality with respect to safety and nutritional value, and enable the distribution of this food to those who need it. 
</p>

<a name="pillarenergy"/>
<h4>3.3.2. Energy Pillar: Independence in Energy Production and Distribution</h4>

<p>
The country must have the capability, on a sustainable basis, to generate and distribute 100% of its energy needs without any dependencies on foreign sources. 
</p>

<a name="pillardefense">
<h4>3.3.3. Defense Pillar: Independence in National Defense and Security</h4>

<p>
The country must have the capability, on a sustainable basis, to defend itself against foreign aggression and all forms of attack, whether by external or internal agents, that threaten the sustainable independence and freedom of Americans in their own land.
</p>

<a name="valuekw"/>
<h3>3.4. Kindergarten Wisdom</h3>

<p>
The basic consideration for guiding individual behavior toward others is the principle that one's rights end where the next person's rights begin. This principle, which we call <em>Kindergarten Wisdom</em> due to its simplicity and obviousness, has the force of law within the State. 
</p>

<a name="precedence"/>
<h3>3.5. Precedence of Authority</h3>
<p>
	The precedence of authority from high to low is:
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Principles</li>
		<li>Constitution</li>
		<li>Legal Code</li>
		<li>Standards and Regulations</li>
		<li>Administrative Procedures</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	The Consitution must be crafted to support the Principles. The Legal Code must be crafted to support the Constitution. Regulations must be defined in accordance with the Legal Code. Administrative Procedures must be consistent with Principles, the Constitution, the Legal Code, and Regulations.
</p>
<p>
	The Principles are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Human rights must be defended</li>
		<li>Kindergarten Wisdom must be applied</li>
		<li>The Three Pillars of Independence must be upheld</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<a name="applicationofauthority"/>
<h4>3.5.1. Application of Authority</h4>
<p>
In case of inconsistency or conflicting interpretations of principles, intent, or law, the statements or interpretation deriving from the higher level of authority will prevail.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Backgrounders</em> are official documents that contain extended explanations of the rationale and basis for the State. They are to be used to inform analyses of legal questions.
</p>

<a name="standardofmodification"/>
<h4>3.5.2. Standard of Modification</h4>
<p>
Sources of higher authority must be more difficult to modify than sources of lower authority.
</p>

<a name="modificationprocedures"/>
<h4>3.5.3. Modification Procedures</h4>

<a name="dissolvingstate"/>
<h5>3.5.3.1. Modifying the Principles (Dissolving the State)</h5>
<p>
    The Principles are the purpose of the State. It is not possible to modify the Principles within the parameters of the State. Therefore, if the people decide they no longer want to live in freedom and/or no longer wish to honor human rights and/or no longer wish to live in an independent country, they may vote to dissolve the State, this Constitution, and all laws, regulations, and procedures derived from the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>
	If such a vote is initiated by the Government, the National Council must vote unanimously with a full quorum to bring the matter before the people for a general vote. The National Advisory Council may override the National Council by an 80% majority vote. The Legal Review Board may override the National Council by an 80% majority vote. 
</p>
<p>
	If such a vote is initiated by the people through the petition process, the petition must garner signature points amounting to 30% of the total signature points of all Citizens. No State agency may override the petition, but the Legal Review Board must conduct a review of the petition process to ensure the procedures were followed correctly. 
</p>
<p>
	If the matter is brought before the people by either of the methods described above, the people may vote to dissolve the State by an 80% majority vote.
</p>

<a name="modifyingconstitution"/>

<p>
	A proposal to modify the Constitution may be initiated by the people through the petition process. Signature points amounting to 5% of the total signature points of all Citizens are required. 
</p>
<p>
	The proposal must be reviewed by the National Advisory Board, which will provide its analysis and recommendations to the Legal Review Board. 
</p>	
<p>
	The proposal must be reviewed by the Legal Review Board to ensure it is consistent with the principles of the State and to ensure the general consistency of the Constitution, and to identify any portions of the Legal Code and Regulations that may be affected by the proposed change. 
</p>
<p>
	The final form of the proposal, including any changes arising from reviews, must be approved by the National Council according to internal procedures they define.
</p>
<p>
	If the proposal is brought to the public for a vote, it must win an 80% majority to pass. 
</p>	

<a name="modifyinglegalcode"/>
<h5>3.5.3.3. Modifying the Legal Code</h5>

</p>
<p>
	The proposal must be reviewed by the Legal Review Board for Constitutional consistency and for potential conflicts with other portions of the Legal Code.
</p>
<p>

</p>	




<a name="modifyingregulations"/>
<h5>3.5.3.4. Modifying Regulations</h5>

<a name="government"/>
<h2>Article 4. Government</h2>

<p>
	The State hereby establishes a <em>Government</em> to execute the will of the people. The Government comprises the organizational structures, administrative procedures, and operating units necessary to implement the purpose of the State.
</p>


<a name="govresp"/>
<h3>4.1. Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
    The Government is responsible for carrying out any and all actions necessary to establish and sustain the conditions necessary for Americans to live in freedom according to their own values without external interference.
</p>

<a name="govrespconditions"/>
<h4>4.1.1. Establish the Conditions of Freedom</h4>

<p>
    <em>Freedom</em> is defined as a "condition of life in which people understand their human and legal rights, their duties with respect to other people's rights, the options and procedures for exercising their rights; and they have realistic and practical means to exercise those options." The Government has the <em>duty</em> to establish and sustain the conditions of <em>freedom</em> in America, making those conditions accessible and realistic for all Americans, to the extent practical.
</p>

<a name="govrespindependence"/>
<h4>4.1.2. Maintain the Independence of the Country</h4>

<p>
	The Government has the <em>duty</em> to maintain the independence of the country from foreign dependencies and influences, especially in the areas known as the Three Pillars of Independence: (a) food production, quality, and distribution; (b) energy production and distribution; (c) defense.
</p>

<a name="govresphumanrights"/>
<h4>4.1.3. Uphold and Defend Human Rights</h4>

<p>
	The Government has the <em>duty</em> to uphold and defend the human rights of all persons within the jurisdiction of the State. 
</p>

<a name="govresplegalrights"/>
<h4>4.1.4. Uphold and Defend Legal Rights</h4>

<p>
	The Government has the <em>duty</em> to uphold and defend the legal rights of all persons within the jurisdiction of the State. 
</p>

<a name="govrespstability"/>
<h4>4.1.5. Focus on Long-Term Stability</h4>

<p>
	The Government has the <em>duty</em> to consider the long-term implications of all its decisions, policies, and actions in view of the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>

<a name="govlimits"/>
<h3>4.2. Limitations</h3>

<p>
    The Government has the <em>duty</em> to refrain from intruding on the individual liberty of Americans beyond the extent necessary to fulfill its responsibilities under Article 4.1.
</p>

<a name="govlimorder"/>
<h4>4.2.1. Assumption of Order</h4>

<p>
    Government operations will be defined, organized, and executed based on the assumption that most Americans behave in accord with the law and in accord with Kindergarten Wisdom most of the time. The people will not be policed actively. Law enforcement will take action when an offense or an emergency is reported, or when there is reason to suspect an offense is in progress or is being planned, or when circumstances of general public danger exist. 
</p>


<a name="govlimconnection"/>
<h4>4.2.2. Connection between Governmental Actions and the Purpose of the State</h4>

<p>
    Any responsibility, policy, decision, or action of a governmental entity must be connected with the purpose of the State in some way. The Government may not assert authority or control over areas of life that are not connected with the purpose of the State. The Government will establish practical mechanisms by which the people can protest and potentially overturn, revise, or reverse any law, policy, or action of Government they believe violates this Article.
</p>

<a name="govlimsectors"/>
<h4>4.2.3. Definition of Public and Private Sectors</h4>

<p>
     Individuals and organizations that engage in economic activity are collectively called the <em>private sector</em>. In contexts where a distinction is intended between the private sector and the Government, the Government may be called the <em>public sector.</em>
 </p>

<a name="govlimrelation"/>
<h5>4.2.3.1. Relationship Between the Public and Private Sectors</h5>
 	Except when necessary to support human rights or the Three Pillars of Independence, the Government will allow free market economics to drive most business activity in the country. When the private sector proves unable or unwilling to support human rights or the Three Pillars of Independence, the Government may take an active hand to provide missing services.
</p>

<a name="govlimservices"/>
<h5>4.2.3.2. Services Not Managed Appropriately By the Private Sector</h5>

<p>
	For most forms of economic activity, the private sector tends to function more effectively and efficiently than the Government. Therefore, most economic activity will be left to the private sector. However, the Government will directly manage services that are necessary to provide for basic human needs and that do not lend themselves to profitable management at reasonable cost to citizens.
</p>

<a name="govlimrescue"/>
<h5>4.2.3.3. Financial Rescue of Failed or Failing Private Sector Organizations</h5>

<p>
	No private sector organization is considered "too big to fail." The Government will not rescue private sector organizations from their own bad management, except when temporary and limited action is required to sustain human rights or the Three Pillars of Independence until such time as the private sector generates new players to meet the demand previously served by the failed organization.
</p>


<a name="govprinc"/>
<h3>4.3. Principles of Government</h3>

<p>
    All governmental structures, strategies, policies, decisions, and actions will be consistent with the basic principles set forth in this Article.
</p>

<a name="govprincunified"/>
<h4>4.3.1. Unified Structure</h4>

<p>
    The Government is a single hierarchy of operational units that administer the functions of the State. There are no states, provinces, or other regional authorities. All regional and local operational units are part of the single governmental hierarchy.
</p>

<a name="govprincparties"/>
<h4>4.3.2. No Political Parties</h4>

<p>
    The State and its Government are organized around values and principles, and not around the political philosophy of any particular party. To reduce the chances that the focus of Government will shift away from the freedom of the people and toward the political ideology of any given party, the State expressly forbids political parties. 
</p>

<a name="govprinclobbying"/>
<h4>4.3.3. No Lobbying</h4>

<p>
    The organized and systematic interaction of representatives of private sector enterprises or foreign governments, undertaken as a way to influence legislation and decisions of the government, known as "lobbying," is a form of corruption and is categorically forbidden.
</p>

<a name="govprincreligion"/>
<h4>4.3.4. Separation of Religion</h4>

<p>
	To assure freedom of religion is a reality, the government must not represent or prefer any particular organized religion or general faith tradition, nor represent or prefer anti-religious philosophies. The government may not assert authority or control over anything that naturally falls under the domain of religion, beyond the extent necessary to fulfill its responsibilities under Article 4.1.
</p>

<a name="govprinclighthand"/>
<h4>4.3.5. Light Hand</h4>

<p>
	The Government must define structures, procedures, and laws in a way that minimizes the size and intrusiveness of Government in the lives of the people, while maintaining the practical capability to fulfill its duties to the people. 
</p>
<p>The Government will seek ways to fulfill its duties to the people that keep administrative overhead and bureaucratic growth to a minimum. At the same time, the Government must not abrogate its responsibilities in the effort to minimize the size of bureacracies or the rigor of administrative procedures. The duty to serve the people comes before the duty to govern with a light hand.
</p>

<a name="govspirit"/>
<h4>4.3.6. The Spirit of the Law Supersedes the Letter of the Law</h4>

<p>
	The purpose of the legal code is to establish norms for the support and defense of individual liberty in areas where the people demonstrate an inability to self-regulate appropriately. It is not meant to dictate every aspect of life at a detailed level. Provided one's behavior is consistent with the principles of individual liberty and respect for the rights of others, technical violations of the letter of the law will not be prosecuted.
</p>

<a name="govoffenses"/>
<h4>4.3.7. Do No Harm</h4>

<p>
	Where no one is offended, no offense has been committed, even if an action was taken that is technically illegal. Similarly, where someone is harmed, an offense was committed even if the specific act or omission is not mentioned in the legal code. In general, the purpose of legal punishments must be to "make things right" for those who were harmed by an action, or by a lack of action.
</p>

<a name="govstruc"/>
<h3>4.4. Structure</h3>

<p>
    The Government comprises a number of entities that have specific operational responsibilities, organized in a hierarchy of authority. The <em>National Council</em> is the primary decision-making entity. 
</p>
<p>
    Operational responsibilities for governmental functions are handled by <em>Administrations</em> that are accountable to the National Council, and that may be further organized into <em>Units</em>. The number and size of Administrations and Units must be as small as is practical while still enabling them to fulfill their respective missions on behalf of the people. 
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the mission of a given Administration or Unit, it may be established (a) on a permanent basis or (b) with a predefined time of existence that may or may not be renewable based on clearly-defined criteria, or (c) with an operational objective that can be assessed to determine when to dissolve the entity. The intent of this provision is to prevent the arbitrary growth of bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Boards</em> provide support to the National Council and other governmental entities in the form of research, advice, review, and validation or opposition to decisions, as well as handling dispute resolution and appeals. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Liaisons</em> are responsible for the relationships between the Government and extra-governmental or quasi-governmental entities of importance to the State.
</p>
<p>
	An <em>extra-governmental</em> entity serves the interests of the people but operates outside the direct control of the National Council in most respects, to avoid top-down corruption or abuse. 
</p>
<p>
	A <em>quasi-governmental</em> entity is formed at the grassroots level to serve regional or local interests and has limited formal authority to enact rules and levy taxes, subject to Government oversight.
</p>
<p> 
	<em>Services</em> support functions that are needed by most governmental entities, and that may sensibly be managed centrally.

</p>

<a name="govstrucnationalcouncil"/>
<h4>4.4.1. National Council</h4>

<p>
The National Council is the primary decision-making body of the State. It is responsible for legislative and executive functions that have national import. 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The National Council comprises fifteen (15) members who are peers; no member outranks any other member.</li>
		<l1>The membership must comprise twelve (12) members, give or take two (2), who hold formal educational credentials at the Bachelor's degree level or greater, and three (3) give or take two (2) who do not hold high-level educational credentials. 
		<li>Members are elected from among individuals who have served on the National Advisory Board and/or the Legal Review Board for a minimum of five (5) years.</li>
		<li>Members of the National Advisory Board vote for candidates to the National Council. The general public does not have a vote in this.</li>
		<li>There is a strict term limit of three (3) years.</li>
		<li>Members are elected on a rotating basis, with three (3) members replaced every three (3) years. The intent is that tenure is long enough to provide consistency in policy, and short enough to mitigate the risk of corruption.</li>
		<li>Any member who chooses Basic Citizenship while on the Council is immediately removed from the Council.</li>
		<li>When a member leaves the Council in the midst of a three-year term, they are replaced within four (4) weeks by a vote of the National Advisory Board. The replacement member completes the former member's 3-year term; they do not begin their own personal 3-year term. If members leave within eight (8) weeks of the next Council election, they need not be replaced on an interim basis.</li>
		<li>After completing a term of service, an individual cannot be re-elected to the Council until after a waiting period of nine (9) years. This is an anti-corruption measure - due to the rotation of members every 3 years, it is unlikely any co-conspirators would still be on the Council after 9 years.</li>
		<li>A member who must leave the Council for any reason other than a Category 1 criminal conviction may stand for election again as soon as they have regained Full Citizenship.</li>
		<li>No person over the age of seventy-five (75) may serve on the Council.</li>
		<li>No person currently serving in the military may serve on the Council.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Modification for the Transition period: Initially, all 15 members are elected at once. Every three (3) years, the National Advisory Board votes out three (3) <em>or more</em> members and replaces them with new members on a 3-year term. No orginal member may remain on the Council more than nine (9) years.

<p>
The National Advisory Board comprises one thousand (1,000) individuals who are Full Citizens. Of these, nine hundred (900) give or take ten (10) must have formal education equivalent to a Bachelor's degree or higher. The remaining one hundred (100) give or take ten (10) must not have high-level formal education. This is to ensure all citizens' perspectives and life experiences are represented.
</p>
<p>
The National Advisory Board has the following functions:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Conduct research and analysis and provide advice to the National Council. The Board may engage the services of outside experts to assist in this work.</li>
		<li>Observe the activities and decisions of the National Council, and raise an alarm when they believe they perceive evidence of fraud, corruption, or incompetence.</li>
		<li>Submit queries or requests to the Legal Review Board to obtain information and opinions about potential problems with the National Council.</li>
		<li>Offer themselves or nominate their peers to join the National Council, and participate in voting by the Board to elect Council members.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Election and tenure:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Candidates for the Board may begin their election campaigns six (6) months before election day.</li>
    	<li>Members are elected by popular vote of all Full Citizens.</li>
    	<li>Terms are five (5) years long.</li>
    	<li>One hundred (100) members are elected annually.</li>
    	<li>Former members may run again after a five (5) year waiting period.</li>
    	<li>For members who are elected to the National Council, the waiting period includes their time on the Council.</li>
		<li>Any member who chooses Basic Citizenship while on the Board is immediately removed from the Board.</li>
		<li>A member who must leave the Board for any reason other than a Category 1 criminal conviction may stand for election again as soon as they have regained Full Citizenship.</li>
		<li>No person over the age of seventy-five (75) may serve on the Board.</li>
		<li>No person currently serving in the military may serve on the Board.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Modification for the Transition period: Initially, all 1,000 members are elected at once. For the first ten (10) years, voters choose 100 members to replace in each annual election. The replacements begin 5-year terms. By the end of the first 10 years, all the initial 1,000 members must have been replaced.
</p>

<h4>4.4.5. Military Liaison</h4>

<p>
The State and the military have a special relationship in that (a) the military must be subordinate to civilian authority, particularly with respect to decisions to initiate or terminate a large-scale military action such as war, peacekeeping, delivery of humanitarian aid, or support for emergency response; and (b) the military must be free to operate autonomously in order to fulfill its mission successfully. Therefore, the military cannot function in a direct line of management in the same way as other governmental entities. The military is considered an Extra-Governmental Institution, and coordination between military and civilian leadership is handled through the Military Liaison.
</p>
<p>
The Liaison will have two civilian members from the National Council who serve on a rotating basis, elected by their Council peers. It will also have the appropriate number of senior military officers necessary to fulfill its mission. The rank and number of such officers will depend on the structure of the military branches and the judgment of military leadership. 
</p>
<p>
Through the Military Liaison, the Government will seek the perspectives and advice of military leadership regarding international relations and crisis situations, and the military will offer information and recommendations to the Government. 
</p>



<a name="govstrucfirstnations"/>
<h4>4.4.6. First Nations Liaison</h4>

<p>
This organization is responsible for relations between the State and each of the indigenous peoples living within the territory of America.
</p>
<p>
The Liaison office is responsible for ensuring the First Nations receive all the rights, privileges, and benefits due them under State law, and to help them navigate the intricacies of the Government bureaucracy. The Liaison may also initiate outreach, educational, and informational programs to inform Americans about First Nations' history, cultures, and languages. 
</p>
<p>
The Liaison will comprise four (4) individuals plus whatever staff support they require. The 4 key members are:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Two (2) appointees of the National Council, selected from Full Citizens with higher education. They have a variable term of service and may be removed if it is shown they are not performing the function properly.</li>
    	<li>Two (2) representatives of First Nations, selected by whatever method the First Nations may define, serving whatever term the First Nations may decide.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
The State recognizes the history that led to the creation of reservations where the First Nations now reside. This Liaison will have the authority to change the status of the First Nations to (a) fully integrate an area into America, (b) separate from America and establish an independent nation-state, or (c) adjust and improve the terms of the special relationship between the State and one or more First Nations.
</p>




<a name="govstrucoperations"/>
<h4>4.4.7. State Operations</h4>

<p>
State Operations is the top of the bureaucracy under which all Administrations are defined. The State Operations office is meant to be as small as possible. Its only function is to coordinate the work of the Administrations. 
</p>
<p>
Each Administration is responsible for the day-to-day operations necessary to support a functional area of Government, such as Healthcare or Infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
The National Council will define which Administrations are needed to fulfill the State's duties to the people. Each Administration will then determine how best to achieve its mission, and whether it needs to define more than one operational Unit.
</p>




<p>
</p>

<a name="govlocalquasi"/>
<h4>4.4.8. Local Quasi-Governmental Institutions</h4>

<p>
Due to the size of the country, the diversity of needs, and the unique issues of local areas, the State allows the people to establish regional and/or local institutions that have authority over certain aspects of life, and that are not directly included in the formal State governmental hierarchy of Administrations and Units. These are called Quasi-Governmental Institutions. 
</p>
<p>
They have the authority to levy local taxes to fund local projects and programs, and to perform other activities necessary for them to carry out their mandates. They are formed by the vote of Citizens within their jurisdiction, and they can be dissolved at any time by the vote of those Citizens. Their authority is limited in that they cannot impose any restrictions or create any laws that contradict State law. 
</p>
<p>
When the people establish a Quasi-Governmental Institution, it must be registered as such with the State. The State then provides oversight to ensure State laws are upheld. The State may dissolve such an Institution if it is found to be in systematic violation of State law.

<h3>4.5. Procedures</h3>

<p>
This section specifies the procedures for changing the Constitution, the Legal Code, and Regulations. The intent of this Constitution is that the <em>Values</em> enumerated under Article 3 are immutable; they are the foundation of the State and its Government. Changes to the Constitution should require the most rigor; changes to the Legal Code should require significant rigor but be easier to accomplish than changes to the Constitution; changes to Regulations should require a reasonable degree of rigor but be easier to accomplish than changes to the Legal Code.

<h2>Article 5. Treatment of Humans</h2>

<p>
The State, its Constitution, and its Government exist for the purpose of maximizing Americans' ability to live, rather than merely exist like animals, and to have the practical, realistic opportunity to pursue their life goals without worrying about basic survival, living as we do in an era when technology makes it unnecessary for people to struggle for bare survival. Naturally, this places humans at the center of everything. Therefore, the appropriate treatment of humans in the system deserves explicit Constitutional support.
</p>

<a name="peoplehuman"/>
<h3>5.1. Definition of Human</h3>

<p>
To understand human needs, uphold human rights, and assure legal rights for humans, we must have a consistent working definition of <em>human</em>.
</p>
                    

<a name="humanlifestartend"/>
<h4>5.1.1. Start and End of the Human Lifespan</h4>

<p>
Human life begins with fetal viability as defined by medical professionals, or the artificial equivalent of same by technological means (including cloning), and ends when the individual reaches the point after medical death when they can no longer be revived to a self-aware, functioning state using technology currently available at a cost accessible to the individual's estate or legal proxy.
</p>
<p>
For further elaboration of the rationale for this definition, see the <a href="bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a>.
</p>

<a name="humanrightsbynature"/><h4>5.1.2. Human Rights Imbued By Nature</h4>

<p>
Human rights are imbued in human beings by virtue of their humanity. They are not "earned;" they are attributes of a human, like bones and blood. They cannot be granted or denied by any authority, including the State. No action taken by a human being changes their fundamental humanity; therefore, no action taken by a human being can cause them to forfeit their human rights. Human rights can be violated, but they cannot be taken away.
</p>


<a name="humanselfdefend"/>
<h4>5.1.3. Humans Who Can Stand for Their Own Rights</h4>

<p>
Humans who are of majority age and are mentally competent can stand up for their own rights. All the following are humans:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
	    <li>An individual born by natural childbirth</li>
	    <li>An individual born by Caesarean section</li>
	    <li>An individual born by emergency medical extraction when the mother was in distress</li>
	    <li>An individual who resulted from artificial insemination of the mother</li>
	    <li>An individual born of a surrogate mother</li>	
	    <li>An individual cultivated in an incubation system, not in a living mother</li>
	    <li>An individual created by a cloning process</li>
	    <li>A pregnant woman (her human rights are not less valuable than those of her unborn child)</li>
	    <li>An individual who has some intrinsic characteristic different from the statistical norm of the society (e.g., minorities)</li>
	    <li>An individual who has carried out horrific acts, such as mass murder (bad actions do not erase the offender's humanity)</li>	
	</ul>
</p>


<a name="humanproxydefend"/>
<h4>5.1.4. Humans Who Need a Proxy To Stand for Their Rights</h4>

<p>
Some humans cannot stand up for their own rights. They may be too young, mentally incompetent, ill, or injured. This does not change their fundamental humanity. Their rights must be upheld by a competent healthcare proxy and/or legal proxy. All the following are humans:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>An individual who is below the age of majority (a child)</li>
		<li>A viable fetus not yet born, developing normally (by natural or technological means)</li>
		<li>An individual who has suffered severe brain damage and is no longer functional or self-aware</li>
		<li>An individual whose brain has deteriorated from disease and is no longer functional or self-aware</li>
		<li>An individual who is "technically" alive only because they are maintained by medical equipment</li>
		<li>An individual who is in a coma</li>
		<li>An individual who has been medically dead for a few minutes but could conceivably be revived</li>	
	</ul>
</p>


<a name="humancorporationnot"/>
<h4>5.1.5. Corporations Are Not Humans</h4>

<p>
	An organization is not treated as a "person" for legal purposes. This includes any and all types of organizations, whether they are incorporated or registered or organized informally, regardless of their purpose. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>A private-sector corporation in business to make a profit</li>
		<li>A non-profit corporation or other organizational type</li>
		<li>A religion, or any organization affiliated with a religion</li>
		<li>A private club, such as a business club or sports franchise</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<a name="peoplehumanrights"/>
<h3>5.2. Human Rights</h3>

<p>
The following are defined as <em>human rights</em> and must be upheld in the Legal Code and in all actions of the State, private sector entities, and individuals. For further elaboration of the intent of this Article, see the <a href="bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a>, especially Section 3.2. This Constitution recognizes <em>no authority</em> with the power to strip a human being of their natural human rights.
</p>

<a name="peoplehumanrightslife"/>
<h4>5.2.1. The Right to Life</h4>

<p>
Everyone has the fundamental right to live. Ending someone's life intentionally or through negligence is a violation of human rights.
</p>

<a name="peoplehumanrightssecurity"/>
<h4>5.2.2. The Right to Physical Security</h4>

<p>
Everyone has the fundamental right to be safe in their own home, neighborhood, community, and country, to the extent safety is feasible in a given situation.
</p>

<a name="peoplehumanrightsliberty"/>
<h4>5.2.3. The Right to Individual Liberty</h4>

<p>
Everyone may do as they please up to the point that their actions interfere with anyone else's ability to do as <em>they</em> please. This is Kindergarten Wisdom: One's rights end where the next person's rights begin.
</p>
<p>
Exception: Individuals below the age of majority (16) are subject to reasonable limitations and guidance from their parents or legal guardians.
</p>

<a name="peoplehumanrightsfreedom"/>
<h4>5.2.4. The Right to Live In Freedom</h4>

<p>
<em>Freedom</em> is defined as a condition of life in which people understand their human and legal rights, their duties with respect to other people's rights, their options and procedures for exercising their rights; and they have realistic and practical means to exercise those options. When someone lacks the practical means to exercise their options, they are in a condition of <em>bondage</em>. The law recognizes the concept of "bondage to a system" that restricts people's freedom.
</p>

<a name="peoplehumanrightshome"/>
<h4>5.2.5. The Right of the Sanctity of the Home</h4>

<p>
No one may enter someone's home without permission, except in certain special circumstances specified in the Legal Code.
</p>


<a name="peoplelegalrights"/>
<h3>5.3. Legal Rights</h3>

<p>
Legal Rights differ from Human Rights in that they may be modified through the procedure for changing the Constitution. They deal with interactions between law enforcement or other agents of the State and other individuals. Most rights in this Article pertain to interactions between formal authorities of the State and everyone else, but some also extend to interactions between individuals and companies in the private sector.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsequalprotection"/>
<h4>5.3.1. The Right of Equal Protection under the Law</h4>

<p>
Everyone will be treated with equal respect for all legal purposes regardless of their wealth, privilege, occupation, position in Government, criminal hitory, age, beliefs, physical attributes, or any other factors that might distinguish one individual from another. 
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsarrest"/>
<h4>5.3.2. The Right of Protection from Arbitrary Arrest and Detention</h4>

<p>
Law enforcement officers and other designated agents of the State are authorized to arrest, detain, and question individuals who are suspected of an offense, but they may not arrest or detain anyone without reasonable cause. No one <em>other</em> than law enforcement or properly designated agents of the State has the authority to arrest or detain anyone. 
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsharassment"/>
<h4>5.3.3. The Right of Protection from Harassment</h4>

<p>
No one is to be harassed in any way by law enforcement or other agents of the State. No one is to be harassed in any way by private sector entities such as debt collectors, marketers, or private detectives. 
</p>


<a name="peoplelegalrightstorture"/>
<h4>5.3.4. The Right of Protection from Torture</h4>

<p>
Law enforcement and other agents of the State are prohibited from using torture or torture-like methods to intimidate, question, or punish anyone for any reason.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsinnocence"/>
<h4>5.3.5. The Right to Be Presumed Innocent</h4>

<p>
A suspect is presumed to be innocent of the offense in question unless and until they are convicted by a court of law.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightstimely"/>
<h4>5.3.6. The Right to Timely Adjudication</h4>

<p>
No one will be held in detention for an unreasonable time while awaiting their hearing or trial. The definition of "unreasonable time" is a matter for statutory law.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightspublic"/>
<h4>5.3.7. The Right to a Public Hearing</h4>

<p>
All hearings and trials are to be open to the public except those in which evidence or testimony may compromise the Defense Pillar.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightspunishment"/>
<h4>5.3.8. The Right to Fair Punishment</h4>

<p>
The punishment imposed on someone convicted of an offense will not be unreasonable or excessive. The definition of "unreasonable or excessive" is a matter for statutory law.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsrepresentation"/>
<h4>5.3.9. The Right to Legal Representation</h4>

<p>
Anyone detained for questioning or charged with an offense has the right to a qualified legal representative. The State has a duty to ensure this right can be exercised on a practical level; it is not sufficient to express the right only in principle.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsholdpeace"/>
<h4>5.3.10. The Right to Hold One's Peace</h4>

<p>
No one is required to say anything when questioned by law enforcement. Their silence must not be used against them in subsequent legal procedures or when determining punishment for any offenses for which they are later convicted.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightshonesty"/>
<h4>5.3.11. The Right to Honesty</h4>

<p>
Everyone is expected to answer honestly when questioned by law enforcment, should they choose not to remain silent. Conversely, law enforcement is prohibited from lying to suspects as a way to trick them into confessing or betraying others.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsincrimination"/>
<h4>5.3.12. The Right Not to Incriminate Oneself</h4>

<p>
Even if an individual chooses not to remain silent, they have no obligation to make any statement that might incriminate them.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightscompensation"/>
<h4>5.3.13. The Right to Compensation for Wrongful Treatment</h4>

<p>
If it is shown that law enforcement or other agents of the State mistreated someone in the course of their interactions, that individual will be entitled to compensation and restitution for the mistreatment. This applies independently of whether the individual is later convicted of an offense.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightswrongfulconviction"/>
<h4>5.3.14. The Right of Compensation for Wrongful Conviction</h4>

<p>
Should a criminal conviction later be overturned, the individual wrongly convicted will be entitled to restitution for actual financial losses, estimated lost income, and compensatory damages for lost property and time served.
</p>
<p>
The situation of a <em>pardon</em> differs from a wrongful conviction. Should the National Council pardon a convicted offender, they may at their discretion offer compensation to help the individual restart life as a free person, but not necessarily to cover losses incurred during their incarceration. The concept is that the pardoned individual is forgiven, but the original conviction was valid. 
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsincarcerated"/>
<h4>5.3.15. The Right of Just Treatment While Incarcerated</h4>

<p>
When incarceration is used as the punishment for an offense, it is the incarceration as such that constutites the punishment. Additional suffering is not justified. Incarcerated individuals must be treated fairly. The details are a matter for statutory law.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsappeal"/>
<h4>5.3.16. The Right of Appeal</h4>

<p>
Anyone convicted of an offense has the right to appeal the conviction. The procedures and limitations of the appeal process are a matter for statutory law.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsdouble"/>
<h4>5.3.17. The Right to Avoid Double Jeopardy</h4>

<p>
Once acquitted of a specific offense, an individual will not be charged with the same offense again.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsparole"/>
<h4>5.3.18. The Right of Eligibility for Parole</h4>

<p>
If an individual is convicted of an offense that defines eligibility for parole, or the court issues instructions for eligibility for parole as part of sentencing, then the individual will not be denied access to the parole process.
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsdueprocess"/>
<h4>5.3.19. The Right to Due Process of the Law</h4>

<p>
Law enforcement officers and other agents of the State must follow legal procedures in all interactions with the public. If it is shown that due process was not followed, a suspect may move to have charges dismissed. In the case of a "technical" violation of procedure, if law enforcement can show they acted in good faith and were not "gaming the system," the charges may remain. 
</p>

<a name="peoplelegalrightsrelease"/>
<h4>5.3.20. The Right of Timely Release</h4>

<h3>5.4. Human Needs</h3>

<p>
<em>Human needs</em> are the things people must have in order to <em>live as human beings</em> as opposed to <em>exist as animals</em>. 
</p>

<a name="peopleneedsdeficiency"/>
<h4>5.4.1. Deficiency Needs</h4>

<p>
<em>Deficiency needs</em> are the things without which people cannot live as human beings, and in some cases cannot exist as animals. The State has a <em>duty</em> to ensure the country can operate on a sustainable basis in a way that supports people's rights and freedoms. When people's deficiency needs are unmet, they become susceptible to external influencers who can take advantage of their need for basic necessities. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is appropriate for the State to take a direct hand to ensure deficiency needs are met. The Government must seek methods consistent with Article 4.3.5, Light Hand, to accomplish this. It is preferable to establish conditions in which people can provide for their own basic needs than it is to provide those needs directly. As a "safety net," the Government may choose to provide some needs directly, possibly limited by circumstance or time.

<h4>5.4.2. Growth Needs</h4>

<p>
<em>Growth needs</em> are the things people need in order to pursue their professional and personal goals in life. In effect, this is the purpose of the State expressed in different words. The State cannot provide growth needs directly, as one of the key growth needs is the need to create one's own success. By supporting the Three Pillars of Independence and focusing on human rights, legal rights, and individual liberty, the State establishes the conditions under which people can provide for their own growth needs.

<h3>5.5. Privileges and Duties</h3>

<p>
A <em>privilege</em> is an activity in which an individual or company may engage on condition of their fulfilling certain <em>duties</em>. In contrast with a <em>right</em>, an individual or group of individuals (such as a company) must earn the opportunity to engage in a <em>privileged</em> activity, and maintain the privilege by following the guidelines established by the relevant standards-setting organization. 
</p>

<a name="privilegesthreepillars"/>
<h4>5.5.1. Industries Supporting the Three Pillars of Independence</h4>

<p>
The opportunity to engage in a business enterprise that supports one or more of the Three Pillars of Independence is a <em>privilege</em>, not a <em>right</em>. The importance of the Three Pillars for the sustainable independence of the country, and therefore the sustainable freedom of Americans, is such that participants in these enterprises must adhere to the standards of performance, quality, and ethics required by law. The specific occupations are a matter for statutory law. Representative examples include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>any agricultural, animal husbandry, fishing, or food processing enterprise</li>
   	    <li>any energy production or distribution enterprise</li>
    	<li>any maker of military supplies, equipment, or training</li>

<h4>5.5.2. Occupations with Societal Impact</h4>

<p>
Occupations with societal impact include any that can cause hardship for people beyond the level an ordinary person can be expected to handle or recover from when they are carried out in an incompetent or dishonest manner. These are usually occupations that require some form of specialized training or education, apprenticeship, certification, and/or licensure. The specific occupations are a matter for statutory law. Representative examples include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>medicine</li>

<a name="privilegesdangerous"/>
<h4>5.5.3. Activities Involving Dangerous Items</h4>

<p>
<em>Dangerous items</em> are those that are inherently dangerous even when used as intended and designed. To own and/or use dangerous items requires some form of verification that the person is mentally and emotionally stable and mature, as well as some form of specialized training and licensure. The specific items  are a matter for statutory law. Representative examples include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>heavy agricultural equipment</li>
    	<li>heavy mining equipment</li>
    	<li>heavy construction equipment</li>
