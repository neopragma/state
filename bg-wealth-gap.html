<h1>Backgrounder on the Wealth Gap</h1>

<p>
Every society throughout history has had different levels or strata or classes, with higher classes holding great wealth, wielding great power, and enjoying what privileges and comforts the conditions of the time and place allowed. History and science both suggest that when the distance (economic, political, social) between the highest class and the rest of the population grows beyond a certain level, bad things happen. That distance is often called the "wealth gap." 
</p>
<p>
Given the State's responsibility to maintain favorable conditions for Americans <em>on a sustainable basis</em>, it is important to understand the potential long-term effects of an excessive wealth gap and, if the data suggest those effects will make the system unsustainable, to build in safeguards against that outcome. The tricky part: It must be done in a way that respects the importance of individual liberty and economic opportunity in American culture.

<h2>1. The Wealth Gap in US History</h2>

<p>
From the founding of the original British colonies in North America until the post-World War II period, the gap between the wealthiest elite and the rest of the population in the colonies and later the United States was extreme. Particularly in the colonies where chattel slavery was practiced, but to a great extent in the other colonies as well, a very small segment of the population held all the real property, all the power, and nearly all the wealth. The rest of the population lived hand to mouth in very poor conditions.  
</p>
<p>
Let's not mince words. While a few hundred people lived in a way that would have been the envy of the greediest Egyptian Pharaoh or Roman Emperor, millions lived under some of the most inhumane and apalling conditions human beings have ever endured, anywhere on the planet. The situation continued for more than 300 years.
</p>
<p>
When the British Crown increased financial pressure on the North American elite, there was a chance their wealth might be diminished to some degree. They took the risk of being hanged for treason by declaring independence. They wrote many fine words, but the intent - and the reality - was that they wanted to control the colonies themselves, without paying anything to England in taxes. What they wanted, in a nutshell, was <em>everything</em>. They were not content with being fabulously wealthy, powerful, and legally untouchable. That was a lot, but it wasn't quite <em>everything</em>. 
</p>
<p>
It is not a heroic story, and so Americans are told a different one. But the reality is that the majority of Americans were quite poor for most of the country's history. This led to all kinds of unrest, from slave revolts to labor movements. Through it all, the top tier of the wealthy elite managed to hang on to <em>almost</em> everything. 
</p>
<p>
Vastly outnumbered, they achieved this remarkable feat by turning the masses against each other. The idea of "whiteness" and systematic racism became established in the popular mind by 1700. It was not a random development. After decades of revolts carried out by mixed groups of black, white, and indigenous people living under slavery or indentured servitude, the small elite class needed a way to prevent people from banding together and cooperating. They emphasized the differences between people and cultivated an undercurrent of mistrust in the population.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, as different waves of immigrants came to North America from different places seeking work, the power elite turned them against each other to make it difficult for them to organize and strike. They hired immigrants of one nationality to break strikes by immigrants of another nationality. 
</p>
<p>
One of the ways they conditioned ordinary Americans to believe this system was best for them as well as for the wealthy was by promulgating the myth that anyone could succeed if only they were honest and worked hard enough. Poverty was the result of personal failure, of "sin." If you were poor, it was because God was punishing you. If you were wealthy, it was because God trusted you to manage the wealth properly. Sympathy for the poor was not only discouraged, it was characterized as acting against the will of God. This message was spread by the newly-created public school system, from church pulpits, by popular traveling public speakers, and through books, magazines, and newspapers.
</p>
<p>
The myth persists to this day, and is the reason so many Americans recoil at the idea of any kind of compensation controls or limits on personal wealth accumulation. They fear their own opportunity to become fabulously wealthy would be suppressed. When they look at the few examples of individual success they see themselves, given a little luck and a little sweat - Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and others. The list is not short, but compared with the population of some 330 million, it is a very small number of people. On the whole, Americans have no realistic chance of "making it big." But they still hope. They still buy lottery tickets. And to be fair, it is not mathematically impossible. 
</p>
<p>
In keeping with utilitarian ethics, it is better if most people are reasonably well-off than if nearly everyone has to be poor in order to support extreme wealth for a very few. 
</p>
<p>
But would Americans be happy with that? Daniel Pink, who has studied human motivation for a number of years, has found that money is not really the primary motivator for people. The role of money in motivation is that people need enough of it that it isn't a "problem" for them. Stronger motivators: Being part of something larger than oneself, and having the practical and realistic opportunity to work toward one's own notion of self-actualization. 
</p>
<p>
Historically, the reason the elite class maintained the largest wealth gap possible was so that the majority of people <em>would</em> have a problem with money. As long as they were hungry and unsure where they would find their next meal, they were controllable, malleable, and willing to accept any terms of employment and any working conditions. So the elite kept the masses in a continuous state of desperation.
</p>
<p>
The key question for defining policies of the State is the impact of a large wealth gap on the sustainability of a country. After breaking from England, the US grew and prospered from the early 1600s until the 1940s with an extreme wealth gap. The benefits accrued mostly to the elite, but also for others, as opportunity naturally expanded along with the territory and commerce of the country. That is a positive point for sustainability with a large wealth gap. 
</p>
<p>
Yet, the country faced several serious problems during that time (to put it mildly), caused in part by the extreme wealth gap and the lack of a voice in government (notwithstanding the fine words of the Constitution), lack of legal redress, lack of economic opportunity, and inability to own property for the vast majority of Americans. That is a negative point. 
</p>
<p>
And if the increase in prosperity was an effect of rapid growth rather than an innate characteristic of the socioeconomic system, was the model sustainable? Growth does not continue indefinitely. It eats as it goes, leaving waste in its path, and eventually it reaches a limit. Growth can be a good thing, but it is not a firm foundation for sustainability.
</p>
<p>
With the emergence of a middle class after World War II, the wealth gap shrank. Thereafter, the general prosperity of the Americans improved considerably. There were no domestically-driven existential threats to the country until the 2021 coup attempt by the Republicans. That event followed 15 to 20 years of gradual economic and cultural separation between two segments of the US population, as well as a broad resurgence of racism across the country. 
</p>
<p>
During this time the wealth gap expanded rapidly, with many Americans losing their jobs and finding only lower-paying work to replace them; often part-time or gig work without benefits. Meanwhile more new billionaires were created than ever before, and corporate CEOs increased their compensation despite "leading" their companies downward. 
</p>
<p>
Among corporate and political leaders in the US, 19th-century thinking about controlling the population through enforced desperation has made a comeback. The lesson of Henry Ford seems to have been forgotten. In the early 20th century, Ford paid his factory workers a decent wage, and he invented the weekend so they would have time to spend their money. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than a mass of desperately-poor people willing to follow literally <em>any</em> orders for a crust of bread, Ford understood the value of a mass of people who had disposable income and spare time: It is the formula for a <em>market</em>. When your product has a market, you make money. An interesting side-effect is that the people no longer have a reason to revolt. 
</p>
<p>
But today's business and political "leaders" do not understand that logic. All they know is that they want <em>everything</em>.
</p>
<p>
This is only one data point, but it suggests a correlation between a large wealth gap and the collapse of a country. It is also the most interesting data point for our purposes, as the US is our country. 
</p>
<p>
The next section summarizes some findings of researchers in the field of cliodynamics. Their results give us a stronger basis to see this correlation in past countries, kingdoms, and civilizations.
</p>

<h2>2. Implications of Cliodynamics</h2>

<p>
Cliodynamics is a multidisciplinary field of research that was made possible with the advent of massive databases, high-speed computing, and sophisticated algorithms. It applies advanced data analytics to large data sets of information about past and present civilizations, empires, kingdoms, and nation-states. Researchers look for trends in the data and evidence of correlation between social, political, and economic factors and the trajectory of states. They seek to identify any common forces or patterns in the rise and fall of states. 
</p>
<p>
Cliodynamics gained a non-academic audience around 2020-2022, when people realized that the events of the preceding decade in the US corresponded with predictions made in 2010-2012 based on analysis of historical data. After the prediction was made, popular articles followed throughout the decade, including <a href="https://theconversation.com/cliodynamics-can-science-decode-the-laws-of-history-8626">Cliodynamics: can science decode the laws of history?"</a> (The Conversation, 2012);  <a href="https://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/economics-cant-answer-why-inequality-sometimes-declines/">"Economics Can't Answer Why Inequality (Sometimes) Declines"</a> (Peter Turchin, 2015); <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-turchin-cliodynamics-society-collapse_n_586f1e22e4b02b5f85882988">"Society Could Collapse In a Decade, Predits Math Historian"</a> (Huffington Post, 2015); and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-are-we-on-the-road-to-civilisation-collapse">"Are We On the Road to Civilization Collapse?"</a> (Future, 2019).
</p>
<p>
Of course, it would be unwise to read too much into any single information source, research method, or model; but it would be equally unwise to ignore data. Data has no political agenda. And the data tell us there is a correlation between a growing wealth gap and the collapse of a civilization, empire, kingdom, or nation-state. This is not a wild guess or a politically-motivated assertion. The implication is that an out-of-control wealth gap creates a risk to the sustainability of a socioeconomic system. 
</p>

<h2>3. Balancing Factors</h2>

<p>
The conclusion feels counterintuitive to us, thanks to our long conditioning as Americans to believe in the mythology the power elite created to manage us. Yet, it is clear that in order to fulfill the goal to maximize Americans' individual liberty on a sustainable basis the State must implement some controls on the wealth gap. 
</p>
<p>
Are we suggesting a centrally-controlled economic system? No. We cannot ignore the fate of centrally-controlled economic systems in the past. No such system has provided a decent material standard of living for the people. No such system has been sustainable. In all such systems, incentives for people to innovate, create, invent, and drive prosperity have been absent. 
</p>
<p>
With due respect for Pink's idea that money should not be "a problem" for people, we need to avoid going beyond the point of diminishing returns in controlling the wealth gap, and we need to be aware of the effects of any policies on people's incentives and opportunities. While money for its own sake may not be the primary motivator for most people, it is a reward for success. People should be able to improve their material standard of living as a result of their own efforts. 
</p>
<p>
Besides that, people want to feel as if things are "fair." One aspect of fairness is that those who invent, create, innovate, or simply work smarter or harder than others receive material rewards. We often mention that we respect individual choice. At times, our expression of that idea may seem a little unorthodox, such as when we say the State has no death penalty, and yet we respect a suspect's choice to be killed should they shoot at law enforcement instead of cooperating with their own arrest. In the context of the wealth gap and perceived fairness, we say that we respect people's choice not to work hard or try to create anything new; they should not suffer, but they cannot expect the same financial outcomes as those who choose to "step up."

<h2>4. The State and the Wealth Gap</h2>

<p>
The key points to be considered in State policies and laws regarding management of the wealth gap are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fairness: Maintain opportunities for people to be rewarded for effort and contributions beyond the norm.</li>
		<li>Sustainability: Do not allow the wealth gap to reach an extreme that invites societal collapse.</li>
		<li>Light Touch: Define the minimal set of policies and laws necessary to support the first two points.</li>
	</ul>
