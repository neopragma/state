<h1>Backgrounder on Education</h1>

<p>
	General education is key to the success and sustainability of any nation in the era of high technology. The State educational system is quite different from the present-day US system, as it is meant to support cultural values and a national operational model suited to the next stage of human civilization, while the present system is designed for the imperial era, now obsolete and fading away.

<h2>1. Goals of the State Educational System</h2>

<p>
The overarching goal of the State educational system is to support the purpose of the State, as expressed in the brief definition that is reiterated at the top of each page in this set of documents. The purpose of the State is described further in the <a href="bg-purpose.html">Backgrounder on the Purpose of the State</a>, the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a>, and the <a href="Backgrounder on the Three Pillars of Independence">Backgrounder on the Three Pillars of Independence</a>. Every aspect of the State educational system is meant to support the values and rights expressed in those documents, the requirements laid out in the <a href="constitution.html">Constitution</a> and the <a href="legal-code.html">Legal Code</a>, and the practical operational needs of the State to fulfill its duty to the people.
</p>

<a name="edugoalcitizen"/>
<h3>1.1. Prepare Citizens to Function as Adults</h3>

<p>
At the most basic level, the purpose of the educational system is to help young people learn to function as independent adults. That means they need to develop knowledge and skills in a few broad areas:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>General life skills.</strong> Getting through a normal day, week, year - nutrition and cooking, basic household maintenance and repairs, managing the household budget, planning for retirement, personal health and hygiene, courtesy and manners, goal-setting and self-discipline, etc.</li>
		<li><strong>Rights and duties of a citizen.</strong> Awareness of the law at a layman's level, understanding one's rights, understanding the difference between rights and privileges, understanding one's duties.</li>
		<li><strong>Navigating "the system."</strong> How to apply for a job, how to start a business, how to obtain housing, how to obtain medical care, understanding contracts, where to find help, how to make use of State services, what to do in case of emergency, how to distinguish credible information from nonsense or propaganda.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
This may seem so obvious that it need not be stated, but in reality the present-day US the educational system does not teach any of these things. Many, if not most Americans lack knowledge and skills in these areas, and struggle through life with great difficulty - always short of money, never quite sure what is going on, not understanding how the system works, getting arrested and never really understanding why, falling behind on taxes or vehicle registrations, not knowing what to do when they need help or an emergency arises, never planning for retirement, not knowing how to cook and subsisting on fast food, suffering with marginal health for years on end, always feeling as if the deck is stacked against them. 
</p>
<p>
It is unnecessary for people to live that way, but they have to be shown how to live more effectively; no one is born with these skills. This is directly connected with individual liberty - how can you live in freedom if you don't know how to live at all?
</p>

<a name="edugoalpillars"/>
<h3>1.2. Uphold the Three Pillars of Independence</h3>

<p>
The educational system must prepare the population as a whole to uphold and sustain the Three Pillars of Independence. This means ensuring the optimal proportion of people enter each field of work when they reach adulthood, so that the balance of skills across the population is appropriate to maintain the freedom of the people. 
</p>
<p>
The country needs the right number of people to enter each critical field, and also needs to avoid the problem of <em>overproduction of elites</em>. From the individual perspective, we want a system that exposes young people to a wide range of career options, and encourages and enables them to pursue careers that interest them and that are a fit for their natural aptitudes.
</p>


<a name="eduus"/>
<h2>2. Current System in the US</h2>

<p>
The relevance of understanding the current educational system in the US is that we are designing the State to serve the same population. We want to understand what is useful and what is not useful in the present US system so that we can design a suitable educational system for America.
</p>
<p>
Many features of the US educational system are historical. Public education began at scale in the mid-nineteenth century. The purpose of public education at that time was two-fold: (a) indoctrinate the masses to believe their lot in life was normal and they should not question the existing power structure of the country and society, and (b) train people to be obedient and orderly so that they would be easy to manage and control as employees.
</p>
<p>
For example, the common practice of forcing children to sit perfectly still and quiet for hours on end, contrary to their nature, was designed to squeeze the energy, enthusiasm, and creativity out of them so that they would grow up to be passive and obedient workers who made no trouble for their employers. The children of the power elite did not attend the same schools and were not subjected to the same treatment as the children of the masses.
</p>
<p>
A system designed with those goals in mind will probably not serve the goals of the State - to maximize the opportunity for individual liberty and enable people to pursue their own ambitions in life. Yet, we should examine the characteristics of the US system as a matter of due diligence.
</p>


<a name="eduusbasic"/>
<h3>2.1. Basic Public Education (K-12)</h3>

<p>
While educational standards are defined at the state level, all US public school systems have the same general structure. Basic education comprises pre-school (optional), kindergarten (optional in many places), primary school or elementary school (grades 1 through 6), middle school or junior high school (grades 7 and 8), and high school or secondary school (grades 9 - 12). There are variations - in some districts, middle school includes grade 9, and in others high school includes grade 8 - but the general structure is the same everywhere. Children begin first grade at age 6. Having completed high school, the individual is deemed to be ready to enter the work force or, if they wish, to continue with higher education. 
</p>
<p>
</p>

<a name="eduusstand"/>
<h4>2.1.1. Inconsistent Standards</h4>
<p>
Educational standards define the knowledge and skills a student is expected to have at any given point as they progress through the sequence of grades. Their achievements are assessed through written examinations periodically - typically at the end of grades 4, 8, and 12, but in some districts annually.</p>
<p>
There is no common set of educational standards at the national level. Employers and institutions of higher education cannot rely on a high school diploma from one state to have the same meaning as a diploma from another state. Even within each state, standards and performance vary widely from district to district or from school to school. 
</p>

<a name="eduusquality"/>
<h4>2.1.2. Questionable Quality of Education</h4>
<p>
The societal expectation is that a high school graduate is prepared to go out into the world. The reality is that most of them have no idea what to do once they are out of school. It is as if they have been <em>released</em> rather than <em>graduated</em>. 
</p>
<p>
Except for those who attended a vocational school with hands-on training in a trade, high school graduates generally have no practical skills - they cannot hang a door, install a toilet, or repair a car; they do not know how to apply for a job or find a place to live; they do not know how to manage their own budget, save for retirement, or pay their taxes. 
</p>
<p>
Neither do they have academic knowledge - most cannot find their own state on a map; do not know the difference between Austria and Australia; believe Africa is a single country; do not know where their food comes from and cannot recognize raw foods when they see them in a supermarket; have no knowledge of history, no interest in literature, and no understanding of economics; cannot distinguish between wild conspiracy theories and credible information; believe astrology is a science like astronomy, and many are not sure whether the sun is bigger than the moon. Technically, they can read and write, but only just.
</p>

<a name="eduusyears"/>
<h4>2.1.3. Years of Schooling Compared with Value Received</h4>
<p>
After 12 years of formal education (14 if we count kindergarten and pre-school), what is the return on investment for the individual student and for the society or country? Given the level of knowledge and practical skills of the typical high school graduate, was the time well spent? 
</p>
<p>
Individuals enter adulthood confused and off-balance, unsure what or whom to believe and lacking the tools to make a judgment about it. They have no idea how anything works or what they need to do to start functioning as an adult. The country is filled with people who are ill-equipped to contribute to the ongoing prosperity of the nation or to defend freedom, because the educational system keeps pouring them out like water from a faucet. 
</p>

<a name="eduusmethods"/>
<h4>2.1.4. Outdated and Ineffective Teaching Methods</h4>
<p>
Teachers participate in continuing education programs and in-service days where they learn about alternative pedagogical methods and about the effectiveness of various approaches, like Montessori, Charlotte Mason, Experiential Learning, Flipped Learning, and others. And yet, the standard procedure in classrooms remains the same as it was in the 19th century - the children sit quietly at little desks in neat rows all day long. 
</p>
<p>
They listen, or at least sit still, while the teacher lectures. They answer the questions printed in the back of their textbooks - books whose content is largely dictated by the largest customers of textbooks, California and Texas, each of which dictates that certain subjects are taboo.
</p>
<p>
The greatest award a student can receive is the one for "attendance." The child who never missed a day of school from grades 1 through 12 is highly praised. But at the end of it all, what do they know? What can they do? Are they independent thinkers with the potential to drive the country forward, or obedient and passive employees-to-be?
</p>

<a name="eduussafety"/>
<h4>2.1.5. Lack of Physical Safety for Students and Teachers</h4>
<p>
As this is written, in mid-2022, the frequency of mass shooting incidents in the US is increasing steadily. An incident occurs nearly every day. Many of these occur at public schools. Public schools are simply unsafe spaces. 
</p>
<p>
While most schools will not experience an incident like this, all schools must try and prepare the students and staff for the possibility. That means "live shooter drills," which have the general effect of instilling fear in the children, which they carry with them everywhere they go, and for the rest of their lives. 
</p>
<p>
Some Americans have proposed limiting access to high-capacity and rapid-fire weapons, but these suggestions have gained no legislative traction. The only proposals that seem to be taken seriously involve arming teachers and training them to shoot. Teachers are not interested in this, with good reason.
</p>

<a name="eduusoptions"/>
<h3>2.2. Options for Parents and Students</h3>
<p>
The free market has produced several alternatives to public schools that many parents are choosing as a way to mitigate or avoid problems with public schools, including quality of education, pedagogical methods, and safety.
</p>

<a name="eduuscharter"/>
<h4>2.2.1. Charter Schools</h4>
<p>
Charter schools are privately-run schools that are funded through tax revenue. They receive funding through the public education system in exchange for teaching the state curriculum and maintaining standards of teacher and student performance at least comparable to those of public schools. Quality varies, but charter schools are often a superior choice from an academic standpoint. Charter schools have more freedom to use alternative pedagogical methods than public schools. However, this option does not solve the safety problem, as students still must attend in person.
</p>

<a name="eduusprivate"/>
<h4>2.2.2. Private Schools</h4>
<p>
Private schools are for-profit or non-profit corporations that are funded by the tuition and fees they charge for attendance. There are many private schools in the US. Some are associated with a religion and others are general. The US is a majority Christian nation, and Christian private schools can be found throughout the country, including small towns. Jewish and Islamic schools are common in larger metropolitan areas. Other faiths generally do not organize private schools. Most Christian and Jewish private schools accept students of other faiths and exempt them from the religious classes. 
</p>
<p>
The academic quality of religious private schools tends to vary inversely with the quality of the public schools in any given locale. Where public school quality is low, parents who are concerned with academic standards shop for alternatives. This creates a market for high-quality private schools, whether religious or not. Where public school quality is high, parents tend to enroll their children in public schools and provide religious education at home or through their faith communities.
</p>
<p>
Private schools may or may not solve the quality problem, and they do not solve the safety problem.
</p>

<a name="eduusonline"/>
<h4>2.2.3. Online Schools</h4>
<p>
A few schools that operate entirely online have become accredited. This is another alternative for parents concerned about academic standards, pedagogical methods, and physical safety. To ensure students receive high quality instruction, this option requires parents to pay close attention and to reinforce or supplement what is taught. It is much safer than sending the children to a physical school, but also demands time and effort on the part of parents.
</p>

<a name="eduushome"/>
<h4>2.2.4. Home Schooling</h4>
<p>
In the US, it is legal for parents to provide basic education for their children at home, all the way through high school. Each state sets its own guidelines and rules, and parents must follow the procedures and keep up with the state's curriculum and periodic academic assessments. This option solves the safety problem, but requires a great deal of time and effort on the part of parents. 
</p>

<a name="eduushigher"/>
<h3>2.3. Higher Education</h3>
<p>
The term "higher education" is a blanket term for all forms of academic education beyond the high school level. This includes Community College, usually a 2-year Associate degree program that can lead to a job or to admission to a university to complete the final 2 years toward a Bachelors degree; and universities that offer programs for Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral degrees, as well as pre-med and pre-law. There are also vocational-technical schools, mostly private but some taxpayer-funded, that prepare students for entry-level jobs in particular fields.
</p>

<a name="eduuspurpose"/>
<h4>3.2.1. Conflicting Goals</h3>
<p>
Higher education is a booming business in the US. There are thousands of universities and colleges all across the country. But the purpose of a university is not always clear to students or to prospective employers of graduates. There are three different goals for universities:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Scholarship</li>
		<li>Research</li>
		<li>Job training</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
<em>Scholarship</em> is the pursuit of deep knowledge in a subject or a set of related subjects. It involves study and research in a field that may not offer lucrative career options, such as archaeology or poetry. The outcome is learning - not money.
</p>
<p>
<em>Research</em> in this context refers to programs funded through grants in collaboration with the government or private corporations. Government agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) benefit from these program as they can use the results for their own projects, and they often hire participants in the research programs. Private corporations benefit as they can use the results of the research to create commercial products that earn large amounts of money, such as pharmaceutical products.
</p>
<p>
<em>Job training</em> in this context means a course of study whose sole purpose is to give students the skills they need in an entry-level position with an employer. This is usually the reason people choose degree programs in fields like Finance or Computer Science. 
</p>
<p>
While all three of these things require study and learning, they are different enough that when an institution attempts to balance all three, it can be very challenging to provide high quality education across the board.
</p>

<a name="eduuscost"/>
<h4>3.2.2. High Cost</h3>
<p>
The cost of higher education in the US has steadily increased since the first universities were founded. As of today, the costs are so high that few students can afford to attend university, and yet most white-collar jobs require at least a Bachelor's degree, if not a Masters degree, even for entry-level positions. 
</p>
<p>
Thus squeezed between the demand for advanced university degrees <em>even to get started</em> in a career, and the high and rising costs of obtaining such degrees, many Americans have gotten into student debt they will never be able to repay. This is clearly not sustainable.
</p>

<a name="#eduuselites"/>
<h4>2.3.3. Overproduction of Elites</h4>

<p>
The phrase <em>overproduction of elites</em> comes from the work of Peter Turchin and the field of cliodynamics - the application of advanced data analytics to massive data sets of historical information. This kind of analysis shows a correlation between the overproduction of elites and the collapse of nations, kingdoms, empires, and civilizations. 
</p>
<p>
The term means that the society produces too many specialists in advanced fields and not enough hands-on workers to keep everything in working order. There are not enough jobs for all the specialists, and they end up working in "lesser" occupations that do not satisfy them. Eventually, the society can no longer support itself, and it collapses.
</p>
<p>
The education <em>industry</em> in the US has evolved considerably from the original purpose, to create passive and obedient workers who accepted their inferior social position without question. Instead, the output of the system is more and more people who hold advanced university degrees. We speculate this is because university courses are taught by PhD and Masters degree holders whose entire careers have been in academia, and they simply cannot conceive of any other career path; so they create copies of themselves.
</p>
<p>
Employers want (and possibly they believe they need) entry-level white collar workers to hold such degrees, although the actual demands of jobs like accountant, manager, or computer programmer do not require that much formal education. 
</p>
<p>
There are simply not enough places in the economic system for all these highly-qualified people to find a niche. A country with a population of 330 million people does not need 150 million lawyers or 90 million engineers. There is nothing for them to do...except to add complexity to the world in order to create jobs for themselves.
</p>
<p>
As a result, many engineers, nurses, and other specialists earn a living working as waiters, delivery drivers, and other jobs that are unrelated to their academic credentials, and that do not have the potential to provide enough income for them to repay their student loans.
</p>

<a name="#eduusforeign"/>
<h4>2.3.4. Training Ground for Foreigners</h4>

<p>
As the education industry continued to grow, universities became saturated with students. To continue their growth, they needed new sources of customers. As of today, many of the most successful advanced academic and research programs in the US are populated almost entirely by foreign students. The US is funding and building the capability for foreign competitors to overwhelm us on the world stage. This is directly contrary to the defense interests of the country, and is a threat to Americans' ability to live in freedom.
</p>

<a name="#eduusnetwork"/>
<h4>2.3.5. "Good Old Boy" Network (Power Elite)</h4>

<p>
Most Americans recoil at the idea that there is a power elite in the US; after all, it says right there in the paperwork: "All men are created equal." In fact the country was founded by and for a certain class of the population, and everyone else was seen as cheap labor. Many aspects of US governmental structure and US law are designed to keep the power elite in place. 
</p>
<p>
Certain institutions in the higher education system, called the "ivy league" schools, have a function other than scholarship, research, or job training. Their function is to sustain the power elite that owns and operates the US. The mantle of power is handed down from generation to generation of the "old families" through these schools. 	
</p>


<a name="eduusties"/>
<h3>2.4. Corporate and Government Ties</h3>
<p>
It is a commonplace to say there is strict separation between the public and private sectors in the US, but in reality there are, and always have been, close ties between the government, corporations, and universities. This is not necessarily a bad thing.
</p>
<p>
We have mentioned cooperation between universities and government agencies such as NASA, and corporations such as large pharmaceutical enterprises that require inexpensive ways to conduct research. 
</p>
<p>
We consider this a positive characteristic of the US higher education system. Putting the facilities and people of universities to use for the general good is cost-effective and beneficial to the economy, the people, and the country's ability to support the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>


<a name="eduustech"/>
<h3>2.5. Vocational and Technical Schools</h3>
<p>
Vocational and technical schools are private institutions that offer job-related training beyond the high school level. They are not considered academic institutions in the same sense as universities, and their mandate is clearly to prepare people for employment rather than pure academics or research. They usually offer programs ranging in length from 6 months to 2 years. 
</p>
<p>
Similar training is offered in some community colleges and high schools, but it is not common.
</p>

<a name="eduusadult"/>
<h3>2.6. Adult Education</h3>
<p>
Generally, Americans begin elementary school around age 6 (give or take a year) and finish high school around age 17 (give or take a year). The environment in public schools is not suitable for adults. When a person is unable to complete high school "on schedule," they need another way to earn their high school diploma. Otherwise, it is very difficult to find a good job.
</p>
<p>
The most common way to achieve that today is to pass the GED exam. According to the GED Testing Services website, 97% of universities and employees accept the GED as equivalent to a high school diploma. 
</p>
<p>
States may offer other ways to earn a high school diploma. For example, the state of New York offers four ways to achieve this; three that are based on different examinations, and one based on completing 24 college credits. 
</p>
<p>
So, the US educational system offers multiple ways for people to earn a high school credential, which is the baseline educational credential for most jobs.
</p>

<a name="eduuscontinue"/>
<h3>2.6. Continuing Education</h3>
<p>
We used the term <em>adult education</em> in a specific way; the same term is also used to describe <em>continuing education</em>. These are educational options available to adults, either as a way to change careers or to learn about subjects of interest for their own sake. Many community colleges and universities offer courses for the general community at low cost or no cost, including fully online courses.
</p>



<a name="edustate"/>
<h2>3. The State Educational System</h2>
<p>
We have spent considerable time assessing the present-day US educational system with an eye toward identifying features of the system that we want to continue under the State system, as well as features that are not relevant to the goals of the State. For example, we have no interest in continuing the "good old boy" club for the wealthy elite, but we do recognize value in cooperation among higher educational institutions, government, and the private sector. 
</p>
<p>
We also admire the options available to enable people to make up for lost time if they were unable to complete high school in the usual way, and to pursue life improvement through continuing education. Pursuant to our goal to enable the maximum possible degree of individual liberty, we appreciate the accreditation of private and religious schools as well as the option to home school. 
</p>
<p>
On the negative side, the lack of physical safety in public schools and the unwillingness of the present US government to address the issue are worrisome. The high variability in the quality of education and the lack of consistent, nationwide standards are also a problem. Politically-motivated curriculum content and censorship on a level not supported by the US Constitution are creating a nation of ill-informed and weak people. Finally, we see no value in the practice of lining the children up in silent rows for hours on end; our system will exploit pedagogical methods that are more consistent with human nature. 
</p>

<a name="edustategoals"/>
<h3>3.1. Goals</h3>
<p>
The goals of the State educational system are the same as the goals of the State itself. The basic knowledge and skills necessary to sustain the Three Pillars of Independence, defend human and legal rights, and enable individual liberty must be provided. In addition, the appropriate proportion of high-level specialists must be produced, but not an overabundance of these. At the same time, we must accommodate the preferences of Americans who have different philosophies or opinions regarding the role of formal education in their lives.
</p>

<a name="edustatebasic"/>
<h3>3.2. Basic Education</h3>
<p>
Basic education prepares the citizen to enter the work force with skills or to proceed to a higher education institution to prepare for a specialized career.
</p>

<a name="edustatebasicduration"/>
<h4>3.2.1. Duration of Basic Education</h4>
<p>
Basic education in the State will comprise eight (8) terms of formal schooling, organized in a "6 plus 2" pattern. The first six terms will cover the same curriculum content for all students. The result will be roughly equivalent to a US high school graduate. By applying what we know about learning, and keeping in mind what an adult needs to be able to do in order to function in the State, we will not need people to remain in school for 12 years:	
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Most Americans are not academically inclined and never pick up a book after they finish high school; there is no need to burden them with many years of formal schooling. They do not want it, and the society never receives any return on investment for it.</li>
		<li>Those Americans who are interested in going on to higher education cannot be stopped from learning; they will be able to prepare themselves adequately without spending so many years in school.</li>
		<li>Research about education and learning, and observations of the outcomes of educational systems in other countries, tell us that a child should remain at home until age seven, and then is ready to function well in a group setting outside the home. The US practice of starting "formal" school at progressively younger ages has not resulted in better outcomes at the other end of the system, when they graduate high school.</li>
		<li>By using effective pedagogical methods, we can achieve equivalent results in less time than a traditional school.</li>
		<li>The first six years of basic school will primarily focus on the goal stated in the section, <a href="#edugoalcitizen">Prepare Citizens to Function as Adults.</a> This includes what Americans used to call "the three Rs:" readin', writin', and 'rithmetic, as well as the life skills and citizenship skills described previously. But this level of education omits mathematics beyond Algebra I, most literature, and in-depth science.</li>
		<li>We observe in almost all cases in the present US system, the first two years of university are spent in remedial teaching of material the students "should have" learned in high school, but did not. In the State system, the final two years of basic education will ensure academically-inclined students have the appropriate foundation to begin university studies without the need for remediation. This is achievable in part because there will be a single, nationwide standard for education. For other students, the final two years will provide practical, hands-on training in job skills, equivalent to a vocational-technical program.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The State educational system does not include early childhood programs such as pre-school, kindergarten, or Head Start. Research indicates children do not need a "head start" and they do not benefit from it; results from national education systems that are considered the best in the world suggest when children begin formal education outside the home at age 7, they achieve better academic results than US students by the time they finish high school.

<h4>3.2.2. Schedule and Calendar</h4>
<p>
The traditional summer break in the US is a historical artifact dating back to a time when the economy was mainly agricultural. The children were needed to help with field work. This is irrelevant in the modern world.
</p>
<p>
The State school schedule has the students in school fewer days per week and fewer hours per day than in the US system. While there is no long summer break each year, the school calendar is spread out so that there are plenty of breaks and time for other activities and growth opportunities for the children. The eight school terms take place over a 9-and-a-half year period. There are summer and winter breaks corresponding with two traditional American holidays: Independence Day and Christmas/New Year. After every second term, the children have six months off before the next term begins.
</p>
<p>
That schedule takes the students up to the age of majority - 16 years old. 
</p>
<p>
The general schedule and calendar is:

<h4>3.2.3. Alternatives to State Schools</h4>
<p>
In keeping with the purpose of the State, we want to enable the widest practical range of individual choices in education. To this end, the State would like to allow private schools (including for-profit and religious schools) and home schooling, once the new system has had a chance to become stabilized. 
</p>
<p>
Initially, all public education through the basic level must be provided by State schools. The reason for this is that Americans have demonstrated, through their behavior over a period of decades, that on the whole they do not in fact provide adequate basic education when they handle basic education at home or in private schools.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there are exceptions. Some private schools provide an excellent education, far beyond that provided by present-day public schools or charter schools. The other side of that coin is that many of these schools are tools of the present-day power elite to raise their children to inherit wealth and power. 
</p>
<p>
Some homeschoolers are very good at teaching, and produce graduates who are well prepared to embark on their adult lives. But most homeschoolers keep their children home for reasons other than to provide high-quality education, and they do not prepare the children to be functioning adult members of society.
<p>
Some religious schools open their doors to students not of their own faith and teach general subjects without including religious indoctrination. But most such schools are vehicles for indoctrinating the next generation of members into the faith, and often fall short in teaching general subjects. Some of them even perpetuate racist stereotypes and the false historical narrative of the power elite.
</p>
<p>
During the time when the country is transitioning between two systems that are as different as the present-day US and the State, the State must take an active hand in socializing the next two generations of Citizens, so they will be able to function well and help build and drive progress in the new system. Significant cultural change is required, and the State educational system is key to guiding that change.
</p>
<p>
Once the new system is settled into place and two generations of Americans have been raised to support its values, it will be feasible to allow alternatives to State schools. At that point, provided all national educational standards are met, alternative schooling can include additional material at the discretion of parents, including religious indoctrination or culture-specific content.
</p>
<p>
Until then, parents and religious orders will have to provide supplemental education or indoctrination outside of normal school hours and curricula, on their own time and at their own expense. The purpose of the State is to enable the maximum degree of individual liberty possible on a sustainable basis, so we will not prevent people from providing supplemental material to their children; yet, at the same time, the State must ensure a smooth transition to the new system.
</p>
<p>
This will not be as burdensome as it may sound on first reading. Under the State educational system, students will attend school fewer hours per day, fewer days per week, fewer weeks per year, and fewer years than in the present-day US system. Parents, municipalities, day care businesses, and religious orders will be able to create organized activities for children during the extended free time they will have available.
</p>

<a name="edustatehigher"/>
<h3>3.3. Higher Education</h3>
<p>
At the level of higher education, the State will not replace the institutions, curricula, or methods currently in use in the US. However, there will still be significant adaptation in the higher education industry, due to other changes that will affect this market. Some of these are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The State eliminates the individual states in favor of a single central government. State universities will have to be funded and managed differently. This change should not be done in an abrupt manner.</li>
		<li>The changes at the basic education level will call for changes in entrance requirements for universities, so that students' progression through their educational experience will be smooth. The intent is that remedial courses will rarely be necessary, and students will be prepared for university-level study when they enroll. This change will have to be implemented on a rolling basis as each class progresses through the system; those already in the middle of the US system will finish basic education within that system.</li>
		<li>Due to the importance of mitigating the problem of <em>overproduction of elites</em>, the overall customer base for universities will shrink. Institutions will have to exercise creativity to adapt their missions and product offerings to match the new educational market. Some institutions will have to become smaller, adjust their curricula, expand services to adult/continuing education and/or basic education, or close. Unfortunately, there are far more institutions of higher education in the US than the country needs; there is no practical way to keep them all operational after the change to the State system.</li>
		<li>Due to the importance of the Three Pillars of Independence, the number of foreign students invited to study at American institutions and to participate in research programs will be reduced. This will also shrink the customer base for educational institutions.</li>
		<li>State programs to encourage people to enter certain fields will mean that many institutions will be eligible for government funding that does not exist in the present-day US; for example, to subsidize the training of new doctors. This may mitigate the business impact of shrinking the overall market for higher education. It is unlikely this will completely replace lost market share.</li>
		<li>Due to the importance of <a href="bg-bread-circuses.html"><em>bread and circuses</em></a> to maintain social stability, university sports programs will be encouraged and possibly supported by the State. As this is a source of revenue for universities, it will partially mitigate the business impact of the reduced customer base.</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<a name="edustateadult"/>
<h3>3.4. Adult Education</h3>
<p>
State schools will offer classes for adults who need to complete their basic education, but were unable to do so on the standard schedule. Classes will be offered on a flexible basis to account for job and family schedules. Both vocational and university-preparation courses corresponding to Terms 7 and 8 will be available.
</p>
<p>
Private sector companies are free to offer similar education and training for a fee. They must adhere to State-defined guidelines and standards to be accredited. It is likely that companies like GED Testing Services will continue to operate in this area. Details of examination questions may change to some extent, but the business model need not change.
</p>

<a name="edustatecontinue"/>
<h3>3.5. Continuing Education</h3>
<p>
State schools will not offer general continuing education classes. However, universities, technical schools, and private schools are expected to offer classes for adults who want to learn for general interest.
</p>

<a name="edustatestandards"/>
<h3>3.6. Standards and Oversight</h3>
<p>
Educational standards will be defined, reviewed, and periodically updated by a joint body of State representatives and professional educators. Oversight to monitor compliance will be handled by the State. The frequency of review is a matter for statutory law to define.
</p>


<a name="edustate"/>
<h2>4. General Educational Considerations</h2>

<p>
	Curricular materials and learning activities are designed to incorporate the following values in whatever ways they naturally fit into the subject area or skill set the students are working on. These are not necessarily discrete topics of study. They are considerations to be "baked in" to the educational process.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes, it may be possible to create lesson plans directly based on one or more of these considerations, using hypothetical scenarios, literery analysis, discussion, role playing exercises, or other methods. More commonly, these ideas will form a kind of background or undercurrent for whatever the learning activity of the moment may be. Teachers must be alert to opportunistic teaching moments to highlight these considerations. Disciplinary action for student misbehavior can often be structured around these concepts.
</p>


<a name="educoreidentity"/>
<h3>4.1. Identity and Unity</h3>

<p>
	A successful and robust nation-state requires a population that feels as if they are part of the system, invested in it, important to it, sustainers of it, recipients of its benefits. The people should feel and act as if they are members of the same team who all share in the risks and rewards of the country. 
</p>
<p>
	Steering the population into a sense of unity and shared purpose will be difficult, given the present-day US as a starting point. Most white Americans cannot face their own history without becoming emotional and defensive, and most others cannot address the country's history without becoming angry at the lingering effects of historical and systemic racism they still experience to this day. 
</p>
<p>
	Yet, there is no way to move the country forward unless the people understand how things got to be the way they are. Denial changes nothing. Resentment changes nothing. History must be taught honestly, without omissions, and with the goal of setting the foundation for progress, and not the goal of laying blame on people who were not alive at the time historical atrocities were committed, or asking them to pay for their ancestors' misdeeds. 
</p>

<a name="educoreethics"/>
<h3>4.2. Ethics</h3>

<p>
	Civilized people act in a way that is consistent with an ethical framework. They <em>think</em> about what they do in terms of that ethical framework, and mindfully practice an approach to life that some people call <em>intentional living</em>. The educational system will encourage the cultivation of this habit. The ethical system of the State is broadly based on human rights, legal rights, individual liberty, and sustainable independence. Topics of study will be presented in the context of these values.
</p>

<a name="educoreeffects"/>
<h3>4.3. Effects and Context</h3>

<p>
	Apart from learning <em>how</em> to do X in a "mechanical" sense, students will be guided and encouraged to consider:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Under what conditions is X the appropriate choice?</li>
		<li>What are the costs and risks associated with X?</li>
	    <li>If we do X to achieve outcome Y, what other outcomes besides Y are likely or possible? (Unintended side-effects, domino effect)</li>
	    <li>If we do X to achieve outcome Y in the short term, what long term effects are likely or possible?</li>
	    <li>How will we mitigate the negative effects of X?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	This kind of thinking applies to everything from designing a product to be <em>fit for purpose</em>, to thinking twice before saying something that might offend someone else, to deciding whether to overload the fork lift <em>just this once</em> to save a trip across the warehouse just before quitting time, to agreeing to write software that circumvents emissions tests on a vehicle, to choosing a sustainable and environmentally responsible approach to large-scale logging operations, to deciding whether to start an extramarital affair.
</p>

<a name="educorediligence"/>
<h3>4.4. Diligence</h3>

<p>
	In this context, <em>diligence</em> is the idea that when we undertake a task, we apply our best effort to perform the task well. We must take care not to go beyond the point of diminishing returns by demanding "perfection," but we also cannot achieve the people's goals if the population performs their work in a careless or sloppy way.
</p>

<a name="educorecollaboration"/>
<h3>4.5. Collaboration</h3>

<p>
	In nearly all areas of human endeavor - business, politics, sports, the arts - the results tend to be better when people with different backgrounds and skill sets collaborate. Most educational experiences provided in the system will be structured for collaboration, so that students can learn the habit of collaboration and the skills they need to maximize positive outcomes from collaboration.
</p>

<a name="educoreindependence"/>
<h3>4.6. Independence</h3>

<p>
	Notwithstanding the importance of collaboration, there are times when an individual must meet a challenge alone. The educational system must help students learn the skills, the presence of mind, and the emotional control necessary to enable them to function independently when appropriate. Independence also pertains to an individual's ethical choices, consideration of effects and context, diligence, and other factors when no one else is around to remind them or supervise them.
</p>

<a name="educoreresponsibility"/>
<h3>4.7. Responsibility</h3>

<p>
	The society functions well when the majority of its members take individual responsibility for their words and actions. The State educational system will strive to teach personal responsibility based on Christopher Avery's <em>Responsibility Process</em>. It is a simple and actionable model of personal responsibility that offers a practical way for people to think about the concept of responsibility and apply it in everyday situations.
</p>

<a name="educorereliabilitybility"/>
<h3>4.8. Reliability</h3>

<p>
	In this context, <em>reliability</em> means others can depend on you to speak honestly and to do whatever you say you will do. 
</p>

<a name="educoredisobedience"/>
<h3>4.9. Duty to Disobey</h3>

<p>
	When we use the term, <em>State</em>, we mean the collective Citizenry of America and the values and principles defined as the <em>purpose</em> of the counrty. The <em>Government</em> as such is not the State. The Government comprises organizational structures and administrative standards and processes to implement the values, principles, and will of the State. The Government is the <em>formal authority</em> of the State; it is a <em>mechanism</em> in the service of the State. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Respect</em>, when it is genuine, is <em>bidirectional</em> and <em>deserved</em>. As long as you respect the values and principles of the State, the Government will respect your individual liberty. When you violate that trust, you may be subject to financial and/or legal penalties. Similarly, as long as the Government upholds the values and principles of the State, Citizens are expected to respect its formal authority. 
</p>
<p>
	The Government is operated by Citizens who accept jobs or who are elected to positions in government service. Humans are fallible, and may use their positions of authority for personal gain instead of to represent the values and principles of the State. Even when everyone does their best to uphold values and principles, they may make mistakes. When these things happen, Citizens have a <em>duty to disobey</em>. They must hold those serving in the Government to account for upholding the values and principles of the State. 
</p>
<p>
	This is not "disloyalty." Citizens owe loyalty to each other and their shared values and principles, not to a bureaucracy. Keeping the bureaucracy aligned with fundamental values and principles is part of Citizenship. Membership in the society is not about flags, uniforms, badges, and guns, nor about singing songs, reciting pledges, and placing the hand over the heart; it is about values and principles - human rights, legal rights, individual liberty, and sustainable independence.
</p>
<p>
	The educational system will foster this attitude - not blind obedience to authority, merely because it <em>is</em> authority, but active observation and participation in the system to ensure it continues to uphold the values and principles of the Citizenry. The people have to keep their system operating within its guardrails, from the bottom up - or their liberty will be crushed from the top down.
