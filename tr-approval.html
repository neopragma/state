<h1>Transition Plan - Public Approval Stage</h1>

<p>
<a href="tr-promotion.html">&lt;= Previous</a> | <a href="tr-inception.html">Next =&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
	In the Public Approval Stage, we will seek the approval of the general public to move forward with the transition to the State system. To do so, we need to understand three practical realities: 
</p>
<p>
<ol>
	<li>How will we know when it is appropriate to enter the Public Approval Stage?</li>
	<li>How will we determine the approval of the general public?</li>
	<li>How will we halt the initiative gracefully, should the public not approve of going forward with the American State?</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Entering the Public Approval Stage</h3>

<p>
	The Promotion Stage will end in one of two ways. Either we will learn that the American people are not interested in changing the system of government, or that a significant proportion of Americans are interested. 
</p>
<p>
	In the first case, we might continue to operate as we did during the Promotion Stage, with the goal of raising awareness of systemic injustices and corruption, but abandoning the idea of taking things any further than that. We might decide to shut down our temporary political party and take no organized action at all. It would depend on the extent of popular support and the specific conditions that led us to see our proposal was not going anywhere.
</p>
<p>
	In the second case, we would shift into the Public Approval Stage of the transition plan. This is not a radical, sudden change in tactics or actions. It is more a change of focus, from general awareness-building to a more deliberate effort to garner support and to encourage people to express that support through letter-writing, demonstrations, social media, political rallies, grassroots publishing, discussions around kitchen tables and backyard barbecues, and other peaceful methods. 
</p>
<p>
	The goal would be to see if we can achieve a tipping point for moving into the Inception Stage. The Inception Stage is a much bolder step, as there is no graceful exit strategy. Such a move requires substantial public support. We do not expect to enjoy that level of support at the start of the Public Approval Stage. 
</p>

<h3>Determining the Level of Popular Support</h3>

<p>
	The "go / no-go" decision for moving forward with Inception depends on our achieving sufficient support for a <em>tipping point</em>. It does not require a "majority vote." This is clear based on the long history of political change in all time periods and all regions of the world. 
</p>
<p>
	For instance, the French Revolution was supported by slightly less than 30% of the general population, according to modern estimates made in hindsight. Even the American Revolution, which led to the creation of the United States, would not have happened based on a popular vote. Only about one-third of white, protestant, English, male landowners were in favor of breaking away from England. Most other residents of the colonies were ambivalent or opposed. 
</p>
<p>
	So, what is the tipping point? The French and American examples suggest popular support between about 25% and 35% of the population is sufficient; possibly even less than that.
</p>
<p>
	The Trump movement in the US demonstrates that those who are willing to step forward and take action can prevail, if only because most people are taken off guard and are unsure how to respond. In their moment of hesitation, they are swept aside. 
</p>
<p>
	Trump supporters have forced their will on others by threatening election workers, walking into restaurants in defiance of mask policies during the Coronavirus pandemic, hijacking local school board meetings, "occupying" state government houses at gunpoint and threatening to murder state governors, and attempting to take the federal government by force in the January 6 insurrection. They even went so far as to carry the seditionist Confederate Batle Flag into the US Capitol - a grievous insult to democracy and to the American people - something the original Confederates failed to do even as their army marched into Washington, DC.
</p>
<p>
	One would expect all participants in those actions to be in prison today; yet, none has been held to account...<em>not a single one</em>. Obviously, our politics are quite different from theirs, yet there is a lesson to be learned regarding how political change can be driven forward.
</p>
<p>
	We estimate that we need approximately 30% popular support to make the decision to move forward into the Inception Phase. But 30% of whom, exactly? 
</p>
<p>
	Of the roughly 330 million Americans, it has been estimated that about 75 million support the Fascist movement one way or another, whether as followers of the Trump personality cult, as supporters of the Republican Party, or as members of radical groups such as the Proud Boys, the Ku Klux Klan, and others. 
</p>
<p>
	The proposed American State would separate the present United States into two countries, one of which is specifically reserved for those people. We call it The Confederacy for lack of a better name, or until such time as they choose a name for their new country. 
</p>
<p>
	That means we need not win them over to our cause, nor consider them as "opposition." After all, we will give them a sizeable amount of highly valuable land rich with resources, with modern infrastructure already in place, and located strategically with direct access to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. They have nothing to complain about. If anything, many of them may well choose to support us as a way to get their own country in the end - an outcome that is not possible if they persist in trying to overturn democracy in the US.
</p>
<p>
	Subtracting 75 from 330 leaves about 227 million Americans. Thirty percent of that number is a little over 68 million. So, we would require less popular support than the Trump/Fascist movement enjoys as of 2024 (about 22.7%). This is achievable, if the American people are ready for change. If they are not ready for change, we will not force the issue. There is no value in fighting for people who don't want improvement.
</p>
<p>
	There is a second constituency we must pay attention to: The military. Support among active and former US military personnel for such things as white supremacy, white nationalism, extreme fringe groups, Fascism, and Donald Trump has been determined to be around 20%. Some active-duty personnel have stolen weapons and other gear from military stores and provided them to fringe paramilitary groups. Some have provided training to such groups. 
</p>
<p>
	That high level of disobedience and violation of military oaths has not affected the overall effectiveness or loyalty of US military forces on the whole. This suggests the military can function effectively when 80% of its personnel remain loyal to the Constitution and the chain of command. That represents a very high degree of resiliency.
</p>
<p>
	Should 80% of the US military choose to support the <em>status quo</em>, it is highly unlikely we will be able to move into the Inception Stage even if a majority of civilian citizens support it. One goal of the Public Approval Stage must be to encourage US military personnel to consider the advantages of changing the political system for the better. 
</p>
<p>
	There exists the possibility that Confederates within the US military would support the change for their own reasons, even if they are opposed to our philosophy. If so, this could be useful for us. We have no military forces of our own, so operational disruptions within the opposing military structure may be the most effective weapon at our disposal. If we can complete the changeover of the civilian government before the military can regain control of their own people, the change will be a <em>fait accompli</em>.
</p>
<p>
	How will we know when the tipping point has been reached? We can't expect to have a general referendum on the proposal, since the existing power elite would not stand for it. Having worked mostly within the system up to this point, we will have to rely on informal, unofficial methods of assessing popular support. We will have to get a sense of the will of the people based on their words and actions. There will be a risk that we make the wrong judgment, and the Inception Phase fizzles from the outset. All we can do is use our best judgment and let the chips fall.
</p>

<h3>Ending the Initiative Gracefully</h3>

<p>
	If we are unable to garner sufficient popular support to move forward, the process of stopping gracefully will not be complicated. As a consequence of our failure to gain support, we will not be in the forefront of political discourse. No one will be paying attention to us. There will be no need for any grand announcement - and no audience for such an announcement. We can just shrug our shoulders and resume our ordinary lives. If the American people don't want change for the better, then they will get what they wish for. That is perfectly appropriate.
