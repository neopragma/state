</p>
<h1>What are legal rights?</h1>
<p>
Legal rights are privileges people earn by following the law and fulfilling their obligations and duties to the society and the State. Unlike human rights, legal rights are granted by the State and can be curtailed by the State.
</p>
<p>
We recognize the following as <em>legal rights</em>.
</p>

<h2>1. Freedom of residence and movement.</h2>	

<p>
This is the right to live anywhere in the country and to establish a place of business anywhere in the country, as well as the right to travel anywhere in the country for business or pleasure without the need for an internal passport or other special requirements. 
</p>
<p>
The State may curtail this right only (a) when a person has been convicted of a crime and the penalty includes limitations on travel or residency; or (b) to deal with an emergency situation.
</p>

<h2>2. The right to work.</h2>	

<p>
Every person in the country who is over the age of majority is entitled to apply for any job without any special conditions, such as union membership, religious affiliation, membership in any particular race, sex, or disability.
</p>
<p>
A person who has been convicted of a crime and who has completed the terms of their sentence is fully eligible to work.
</p>
<p>
The State may curtail this right only when the person has been found to be a threat to the independence of the country (the Three Pillars of Independence).
</p>

<h2>3. The right to engage in business.</h2>	

<p>
Every person in the country who is over the age of majority is entitled to start and operate a business.
</p>
<p>
The State may curtail this right only when the person (a) has been convicted of a crime and has not completed the terms of their sentence; or (b) has been found to be a threat to the independence of the country (the Three Pillars of Independence).
</p>

<h2>4. The right to a voice in government.</h2>	

<p>
Subject to the structure and rules defined for voting, every citizen has the right to a voice in the decisions of the State. Residents who are not citizens do not have this right.
</p>
<p>
The structure and rules for voting are designed to minimize the chances of substantially damaging decisions that would affect the Three Pillars of Independence. This is a reaction to decisions made by the US voting public in the period 2016 to 2022 that reduced the nation's credibility and influence in the world, and created internal disunity that has been exploited by foreign actors to weaken the country.  
</p>
<p>
Due to the structure and rules for voting, not all votes carry the same weight, and some citizens cannot vote in matters of national security. However, every citizen has the right to cast a vote in nearly all situations where voting is called-for.
</p>
<p>
A procedure for petitioning the government provides another avenue for citizens to express their voice. The Decision Making Council is required by law to consider any matter that is raised through the petition system. 
</p>
<p>
Curtailment of the right to vote is built into the system of justice and is not decided arbitrarily by the State. The right to vote is never permanently lost, even when the person is convicted of a crime. After completing their sentence, convicted criminals regain the right to vote.
</p>
<p>
Another way to have a voice in government is to join the government. Any citizen may run for public office or apply for a position with a State agency if they (a) are Full Citizens, (b) meet general eligibility requirements for work, and (c) fulfill any special requirements for particular levels of government or organs of the State.
</p>
<p>
Membership on the National Advisory Board and the Decision Making Council also require higher education at least to the level of Bachelor's degree. Membership on the Decision Making Council further requires a defined minimum duration of service on the National Advisory Board.
</p>

<h2>5. Protection against double jeopardy.</h2>

<p>
A person acquitted in court of a crime cannot be charged again for the same occurrence of the crime. 
</p>
<p>
The State may curtail this right only when (a) compelling evidence comes to light after the fact regarding the person's guilt in the matter; or (b) fraud in the original proceeding is proven.
</p>

<h2>6. Property ownership.</h2>

<p>
Everyone has the right to own property and to use, subdivide, lease, and sell their property as they see fit, subject to laws concerning environmental stewardship and local regulations regarding built structures, boring into the ground, blocking the flow of water through the property, noise and light control regulations, and releasing chemicals or radiation into the air or water. Other limitations may apply, if the property owner has signed agreements such as homeowners' association rules that impose additional restrictions on property use.
</p>
<p>
People other than the property owner have no automatic right to be present on private property. The property owner can make rules regarding attire and safety of those visiting the property. This provision is included as a reaction to belligerent people during the Coronavirus pandemic forcing their way into privately-owned businesses that asked customers to wear masks, and asserting their "right" to enter the property. 
</p>
<p>
However, these rights do not supercede fundamental human rights and cannot be used as a proxy to deny business services to members of particular races, religions, or nationalities, or for other arbitrary reasons in violation of human rights.
</p>
<p>
The State may curtail this right only (a) when the actions of the property owner are damaging to the Three Pillars of Independence; (b) in case of an emergency situation that requires temporary use of private property for the public good.
</p>

<h2>7. Freedom of thought and belief.</h2>

<p>
Everyone is free to believe in and belong to any philosophical or religious tradition and to practice any rites associated with that belief system without interference, provided such rites do not otherwise violate law or the human or legal rights of other people.
</p>
<p>
The State may curtail this right only (a) when the belief system promotes violence against others or encourages interference in the rights of others; or (b) when the belief system directly contradicts or opposes the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>

<h2>8. Freedom of expression.</h2>

<p>
Everyone is free to express their opinions and to protest what they consider to be injustice. This is not limited to recognized professional journalists who criticize the State or its operatives, but also includes citizens and legal residents of the country. 
</p>
<p>
Any and all media and forms of expression may be used, with the exception of actions that (a) interfere with other people's rights, (b) result in damage to public or private property, (c) interfere with a person's ability to earn a living or live in peace on the basis of unfounded or false statements, (d) create a physical danger to anyone, or (e) interfere with the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>
<p>
The State may curtail this right only when the limitations stated above are violated.
</p>
<p>
People in the US <em>circa</em> 2022 seem to have some confusion about what it means to express an opinion. Speaking, writing, marching, singing, chanting, shouting, waving signs, contacting elected representatives, circulating petitions, and similar activities qualify as "expression." Breaking windows, destroying property, sending death threats to people, stalking people in real life or in cyberspace, setting fires, setting off explosives, and shooting people do not quality as "expression." If this continues to be unclear to people, then the State will clarify it through the prosecution of such crimes and the level of penalties they incur.
</p>
<p>
There is also general confusion about the difference between expressing an opinion and expecting the world to transform itself to align with that opinion. Under the proposed system of government, the actions of the State are driven by consideration of human needs, human rights, and legal rights and the principle that only by maintaining the Three Pillars of Independence can the State provide an environment in which those rights can flourish. Opinions contrary to that principle may be expressed freely, but the foundation of the State will not shift away from it.
