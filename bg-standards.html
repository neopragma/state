<h1>Backgrounder on Standards</h1>

<p>
The State will be responsible for standards, but State employees are unlikely to have the specialized knowledge necessary to define, assess, and update standards or to conduct reviews of compliance. The State will depend on professional organizations to support this function of government. In almost every area, the existing standards organizations and the coordination of those organizations are already handled well by the organizations and government agencies in place. The State will avoid breaking anything that already "works."

<h2>1. National and International Coordination of Standards</h2>

<p>
The State intends to carry over the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) intact from the US system. ANSI performs this function very well, and there is no reason to change it. ANSI is the country's point of contact with the International Organization for Standards (ISO). ANSI coordinates the work of some 240 standards-setting organizations in many fields.  See <a href="ansi.org/">ansi.org</a> for more information about ANSI. Nothing about ANSI would change under the State system except references to "United States" in ANSI documents and websites.
</p>
<p>
All the standards "incorporated by reference" (IBR) are also carried over to the new system. A wide range of industrial standards are managed in this way, such as standards for heating and air conditioning, home appliances, valves and fittings, electrical, materials, ergonomics, acoustics, water management, engineered wood, petroleum, construction, welding, and more. See the <a href="https://ibr.ansi.org/">ANSI IBR Standards Portal</a> for information on these standards and a list of the standards organizations involved. 
</p>

<h2>2. National Standards Related To Time, Measurement, Data, Software, and Information Security</h2>

<p>
The State intends to carry over the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intact from the US system. The mission of the NIST to work "with industry and academia to enhance economic security and improve our quality of life" is consistent with the purpose of the State. NIST currently operates very well, and there is no reason to change it. Nothing about the NIST would change under the State system except references to "United States" in NIST documents and websites.
</p>

<a name="medical"/>
<h2>3. Medical Standards</h2>

<p>
Medical standards will be set and periodically reviewed and updated by members of professional organizations that already exist in the present-day US. Oversight and compliance enforcement will be a joint responsibility of the State and selected members of the professional organizations.
</p>
<p>
Organizations include:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/">American Medical Association (AMA)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.ada.org/">American Dental Association (ADA)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.apa.org/">American Psychological Association (APA)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.ncchc.org/">National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC)</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The State recognizes accupressure/accupuncture as a medical treatment. No single authoritative standards organization exists for this area of medical practice. The State will encourage the formation of such an organization through cooperation among the several existing professional organizations for accupuncturists.
</p>

<a name="workplace"/>
<h2>4. Workplace Safety Standards</h2>

<p>
In the present-day US system, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the US Department of Labor defines and oversees standards in the areas of personal protective equipment for workers, handling toxic and hazardous substances, and health care and social assistance. The third category might seem out of place, but in fact OSHA standards for health care and social assistance cover personal protective equipment and toxic/hazardous materials in the health care space. OSHA standards also cover such things as fire extinguishers, ladders, stairways, sanitation, and the posting of safety notices in work places.
</p>
<p>
We see no reason to change any of this under the State system.
</p>

<h2>5. Environmental Standards</h2>

<p>
	A number of formal standards exist with the goal of helping governments and corporations set up environmental management systems and to measure the success of those systems. However, most of these standards are in the nature of <em>specific things to do</em> rather than <em>outcomes to be achieved</em>. Success is defined as <em>doing all the things</em> rather than as <em>achieving the desired outcomes</em>. Examples include: 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-environmental-management.html">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</a>
			<ul>
				<li>ISO 14001 - design an environmental management system</li>
				<li>ISO 14004 - guidance for making effective use of ISO 14001</li>
				<li>ISO 19011 - a standard for auditing a management system, such as one based on ISO 14011</li>
				<li>ISO 14006 - guidelines for incorporating "ecodesign"</li>
				<li>ISO 14020 - environmental labels</li>
				<li>ISO 14040 - environmental management lifecycle assessment</li>
				<li>ISO 14050 - environmental management vocabulary</li>
				<li>ISO 14064-1 - quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals</li>
				<li>ISO 14066 - competence requirements for greenhouse gas verification teams</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li class="linespace"><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I">United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40: Protection of Environment</a>
			<ul>
				<li>A - General</li>
				<li>B - Grants and Other Federal Assistance</li>
				<li>C - Air Programs</li>
				<li>D - Water Programs</li>
				<li>E - Pesticide Programs</li>
				<li>F - Radiation Protection Programs</li>
				<li>G - Noise Abatement Programs</li>
				<li>H - Ocean Dumping</li>
				<li>I - Solid Wastes</li>
				<li>J - Superfund, Emergency Planning, and Community Right-to-Know Programs</li>
				<li>N - Effluent Guidelines and Standards</li>
				<li>O Part 501 - State Sewage Sludge Management Program Regulations</li>
				<li>O Part 503 - Standards for the User or Disposal of Sewage Sludge</li>
				<li>Q Part 600 - Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Exhaust Emissions of Motor Vehicles</li>
				<li>Q Part 610 - Fuel Economy Retrofit Devices</li>
				<li>R - Toxic Substances Control Act</li>
				<li>U - Air Pollution Controls</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	ISO 14001 includes a <em>plan-do-check-act</em> (PDCA) cycle to help people understand whether they are making progress toward their goals, and to guide changes to the program to target the goals more effectively. However, even the terminology suggests the standard is not up to date - the name PDCA was changed many years ago to PDSA, or <em>plan-do-study-act</em>. ISP 14001 also has a formal certification program; a factor that almost guarantees the standard will stagnate and become a routine bureaucratic requirement that may or may not correspond with any real-world needs. 
</p>
<p>
	The standards defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and defined under Title 40 of the US Code of Federal Regulations contain quite a lot more useful and practical information that is in the nature of <em>standards</em> rather than simply <em>activity</em>, and specific guidelines for measurement, but there is also a significant amount of bureaucratic complexity pertaining to forms to submit for various purposes and fees to pay for various things. 
</p>
<p>
	The State will continue all the US regulations initially while conducting a general review of Title 40 with the goal of focusing on outcomes, collapsing redundant sections, and simplifying the required documentation and procedures. Initially we consider the ISO standards to be less practical than the EPA standards.

<h2>6. Communication Infrastructure Standards</h2>

<p>
	The State intends to continue the operation of the US Federal Communications Commission unchanged at the outset of the transition period. During the transition period, the State will undertake a review of FCC purpose, structure, standards, procedures, and operations to ensure alignment with the Three Pillars of Independence. Any changes will be undertaken gradually and with due consideration to minimize disruption.
</p>

<a name="consumer"/>
<h2>7. Consumer Protection Standards</h2>

<p>
	The State intends to continue the operation of the US Federal Trade Commission unchanged at the outset of the transition period. During the transition period, the State will undertake a review of FTC purpose, structure, standards, procedures, and operations to ensure alignment with the State's commitment to sustainable economic strength.
</p>

<a name="investor"/>
<h2>8. Investor Protection (Trade) Standards</h2>

<p>
	The State intends to continue the operation of the US Securities and Exchange Commission unchanged at the outset of the transition period. During the transition period, the State will undertake a review of SEC purpose, structure, standards, procedures, and operations to ensure alignment with the State's commitment to sustainable economic strength.

<h2>9. Standards Outside the Scope of Government</h2>

<p>
A number of standards and standard-defining organizations exist that have nothing to do with achieving the goals of the State with respect to human rights, legal rights, or the Three Pillars of Independence. Nearly all of these are commercial standards that are mainly used to categorize businesses for marketing purposes. This has nothing to do with the legitimate function of government. We list a few examples here, as the way these standards are presented to the public can give the impression they are authoritative. This is not to say these standards are not useful - they are commercial products, and if customers did not find them useful, they would not purchase them. We only say they are outside the scope of the functions of government.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://siccode.com/">SIC Code - Standard Industry Classification</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.naics.com/">NAICS - North American Industry Classification System</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns-number.html">D-U-N-S Number - Dun &amp; Bradstreet Industry Classification System</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
As these are private enterprises, they will not be affected by the implementation of the State system.
</p>
<p>
Just as some standards are really commercial products and not "standards" as such, some genuine standards may look like commercial products. Examples:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.theswiftcodes.com/">SWIFT and BIC Codes</a> - part of the <a href="https://www.iso9362.org/isobic/overview.html">ISO 9362</a> standard</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Another potential source of confusion is the fact some governmental agencies use commercially-defined codes. For example, OSHA uses the NAICS to classify businesses. 
</p>
<p>
Some independent (not commercial) standards are used in the private sector and are not relevant to the operation of the State. A few examples:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.sasb.org/about/sasb-and-other-esg-frameworks/">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Standards/Frameworks - CDP, CDSB, GRI, IIRC, SASB</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.accounting.com/resources/gaap/">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles - GAAP</a></li>		
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>10. Questionable Standards</h2>

<p>
Some standards or common practices in the present-day US may not be <em>bona fide</em> standards at all, but rather ways to work around the law, particularly to avoid taxation. One that we recognize as such is the practice of capitalizing the costs of software development. As the name implies, software is not a "hard" ware - it is not physical. A physical product cannot be changed (much) after it has been made. Therefore, it makes sense to capitalize the costs of making a product such as a tractor or a sofa. In contrast, software is put to use almost from the very start of its development, and continues to be developed throughout its lifetime. A software product is never "finished" until it is retired from service. There is no line of demarcation between "development" and "use." Therefore, all costs related to a software product should be expensed. 
</p>
<p>
We call out this example because we happen to have the expertise to see through it. There may be many examples of "trickery" that experts in each field would recognize as "not really standards." The State will be alert to these and seek to close the legal loopholes they exploit.
