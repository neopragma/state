<h1>Definitions</h1>
<p>
These are the meanings we intend for certain terms that occur frequently in these documents. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>America.</strong> The name of the nation-state under the jurisdiction of the State. In standard usage, the terms <em>America</em> and <em>the Americas</em> refer to the western hemisphere of Earth. In common usage, the term <em>America</em> is shorthand for <em>The United States of America</em>. The State defines a single nation-state rather than a federation of quasi-autonomous states. Therfore, the term "United States" is not meaningful. We cannot predict whether all the people currently residing in the US would choose to join the State, nor whether others, currently residing in neighboring territories, might choose to join. Therefore, we adopt the common-usage term <em>America</em> as the complete name of the proposed nation-state.</p>
<p>
<strong>bondage.</strong> A condition of life in which people have no realistic or practical means to exercise their human rights and/or legal rights. Our meaning is broader than slavery as such. We consider it meaningful to say a person is <em>in bondage to the system</em>. Such a person may <em>technically</em> be "free" to do this or that, but has no practical means to act on their desire to do so. This definition enables us to reason about how the system might be adjusted to serve the needs of the people effectively. 	
</p>
<p>
<strong>duties.</strong> (a) Things members of the society are expected to contribute to the society, and behaviors toward other people that are necessary for harmonious coexistence within the society; rules that must be followed to earn and maintain certain privileges; (b) things the State is expected to do to fulfill its purpose in service to the people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>freedom.</strong> A condition of life in which people understand their human and legal rights, their duties with respect to other people's rights, their options and procedures for exercising their rights; and they have realistic and practical means to exercise those options. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Government, the.</strong> The set of legal entities or organizations, procedures, regulations, and other administrative elements necessary to execute will of the State. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>human needs.</strong> Things that are necessary for a person to live and thrive <em>as a human being</em>, as opposed to existing like an animal or a "resource." This includes physical needs such as oxygen and water, and psychological/emotional needs such as a sense of belonging to something greater than oneself and the opportunity to pursue goals in life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>human rights.</strong> Fundamental rights to which all people are entitled by virtue of the fact they are human beings. A government can neither grant nor take away human rights. A government that violates human rights is subject to corrective action at the hands of the people it ostensibly serves. Statutory law that is determined to violate human rights will be voided as soon as the violation is discovered.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kindergarten Wisdom.</strong> The principle that one's rights end where the next person's rights begin. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>legal rights.</strong> Procedures and standards of treatment pertaining to people's interaction with law enforcement organizations and personnel. The State is prohibited from violating anyone's legal rights.
</p>
<p>
<strong>privileges.</strong> Opportunities people may enjoy on condition of fulfilling specified obligations or duties. A government can establish requirements and procedures for people to earn a privilege. A government can limit, suspend, or withdraw privileges by following prescribed procedures in accordance with law when people fail to fulfill the duties associated with those privileges. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>State, the.</strong> The collective body of the Citizens of America.
