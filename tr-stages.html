<h1>Transition Plan - Stages</h1>

<p>
<a href="transition.html">&lt;= Previous</a> | <a href="tr-promotion.html">Next =&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
	The transition is expected to be gradual. Yet, some general stages can be identified in which the bulk of the activity will center on one or a few key objectives, and in which certain challenges will present themselves more forcefully than others. 
</p>

<h2>Summary of Transition Stages</h2>

<h3>1. Promotion Stage</h3>

<p>
	If the people do not agree to the shift to the American State, then it will not happen at all. Therefore, there are two preliminary stages that must be completed before any real action can be taken. 
</p>

<p>
	In the Promotion Stage, information about the State is presented to the public for review, comment, feedback, discussion, and debate. Any and all details of the political model are subject to change during this phase, except the fundamental goal of the State as shown at the top of each page. The transition plan itself is subject to change, as well. 
</p>
<p>
	There is no predefined time limit for the Promotion Stage. It will continue until either (a) sufficient public support becomes evident to justify holding a referendum, or (b) those promoting the idea perceive that no strong public support is forthcoming, and it is prudent to discontinue the program. 
</p>

<h3>2. Public Approval Stage</h3>

<p>
	In the Public Approval Stage, we will seek the approval of the general public to move forward with the transition to the State system. As of the date of writing, we have not determined the detailed procedures to accomplish this. It will take the form of a public referendum of some kind. We expect the details to emerge from the Promotion Stage, assuming the idea gains any traction.
</p>
<p>
	At the conclusion of the Public Approval Stage, if the people of the United States do not wish to move forward, then the initiative ends. However, it is possible that the process of open discussion and debate about the ideas of the State system will influence voters and legislators to make positive changes within the boundaries of the existing US system, or in some of the states.
</p>
<p>
	For the idea to reach this far, it would have to have earned significant public support. Some of the provisions of the State model may find their way into the existing system, in the end. Should the people decide against the new system, we hope some of the ideas concerning human rights, universal healthcare, management of the wealth gap, and ending imperialistic foreign policy would continue to be part of public discourse.
</p>

<h3>3. Inception Stage</h3>

<p>
	If the people decide to move forward with the change, we anticipate the existing US government, and probably state governments, will not consider the referendum to be binding and will not cooperate in their own dissolution. After all, the people who operate the present-day system in the US are the very power elite the State seeks to unseat in favor of the people. They will not recognize anyone's authority to discontinue the system defined in the US Constitution.
</p>
<p> 
	Unlike the Constitution for America, the US Constitution does not contain provisions defining how the system of government might be shut down in an orderly way; the idea of shutting it down was simply not something the Founders considered. There is no way to close down the old system by following the rules of the old system. Those in power must be convinced to help in the change or at least to stand aside.
</p>
<p>
	For that reason, we anticipate an Inception Stage may be necessary, in which the administrative machinery for implementing the State system is put into operation over the strong objections of those who currently enjoy positions of power and privilege. Until those objections have been answered, we will be unable to work unmolested toward positive change. We are hopeful many members of the power elite will see the benefit to themselves in the new system, and help in the transition. Otherwise, this may be the point at which the initiative stops.
</p>
<p>
	The Inception Stage is the period when the country will be at greatest risk of foreign intervention. The level of risk will vary in direct proportion to the extent and forcefulness of domestic resistance to the change. Such resistance will divide the people against each other and increase the country's vulnerability to external influences and physical attack. Therefore, organized violent resistance must be halted quickly.
</p>
<p>
	US history can be viewed as a repeated series of pulses or cycles in which the power elite squeezes the people harder and harder until the people rise up, and then the power elite crushes them through a combination of payoffs, threats, economic pressure, and violence. This has happened with respect to slave revolts, labor movements, voting rights movements, civil rights, and protests against wars of aggression undertaken to enrich large corporations and elite families. 
</p>
<p>
	This idea could very well meet the same fate. Even so, there have been times when the people gained a little ground after one of these pulses - voting rights, civil rights, assistance for poor children, affirmative action, Social Security, etc. So, there is hope for positive change, even if the initiative ends in the Inception Stage.
</p>

<h3>4. Dual-System Stage</h3>

<p>
	It is not realistic to flip a switch and immediately begin operating under the State system. The very structure of government must change, from a collection of quasi-autonomous states to a single nation-state. The restructuring will affect every institution of public life. 
</p>
<p>
	The individuals responsible for implementing the changes will not know just what to do at first, even if their intentions are good. Government officials, law enforcement personnel, attorneys and judges, teachers, and business leaders will be starting to swim in unfamiliar waters. They will have to learn the new system even while they implement it. For a period of years, many things must operate partly in the old way and partly in the new, gradually shifting more and more toward the new. People will make many mistakes along the way.
</p>
<p>
	Business contracts, patents, copyrights, and other legal matters that were initiated prior to the Inception Stage and whose duration extends into the Dual-System Stage must be managed fairly. Students who began school under the old educational system must complete their education under the same system, while the next cadre of students begin their studies under the new system. Businesses connected with the Three Pillars of Independence have not been accustomed to operating with that concept in mind; their operational standards and procedures cannot change abruptly. Families must register as households, if they wish, as the State does not recognize religious marriage for legal purposes. Foreign owners of real property must have time to divest that property, as the State does not allow such foreign ownership. There are many other examples of changes that must be achieved gradually and mindfully.
</p>
<p>
	Although physical threats will have been quelled before we start the Duel-System Stage, the new system will still be at risk of failure. Many things can go wrong, and even if everything proceeds well, it is likely people will be negatively affected by the changes in the short term, and they may lose their will to continue. There will be a natural tendency for people to reach for the familiar. Even though they approved of the idea of the State previously, the people simply may find it too difficult to complete the task.
</p>
<p>
	This is the most difficult stage in the transition, and probably the longest. It is the time when all the deep changes from old to new must be phased in thoughtfully. 
</p>
<p>
	Apart from the natural challenges in beginning changes of such scope, there will still remain opposition to the idea, even after we have gained sufficient support to begin the work in earnest. Those opposed will use every tool at their disposal to scuttle the effort, from propaganda to violence. 
</p>
<p>
	The risk of foreign intervention is much lower than in the Inception Stage, because the international community will see that the country is intact and operational. However, the Dual-System Stage is at risk from internal factors. It ends when either (a) the people decide they cannot overcome the natural challenges of making the changes and/or the violent resistance by those opposed, or (b) the shift from old to new reaches a tipping point, and things start to operate more-or-less smoothly under the new system.
</p>

<h3>5. Consolidation Stage</h3>

<p>
	The main transitional activity at this point is to terminate any remaining functions that had been carried over from the old system in the Dual-System Stage.
</p>
<p> 
	This is the time for individuals and territories to come to their final decisions about whether to join America.
</p>
<p>
	Citizens of former US states other than the Confederacy, and citizens of the District of Columbia, who do not wish to remain in America will have had ample time to make alternative arrangements, and this will be the time for them to relocate. Conversely, residents of the Confederacy who prefer to live in America must by this time have completed their relocation to locales within America. Any special agreements for managing cross-border traffic between the Confederacy and the American State will be terminated gracefully, and the border will be treated as any other international border.
</p>
<p>
	Territories formerly part of the US in which the people have collectively decided to separate from America, and former US possessions and indigenous areas whose people may choose to join America or become independent countries, must finalize their decisions during the Consolidation Stage. 
</p>

<h3>6. Closing</h3>

<p>
	Closing isn't so much a "stage" in its own right as it is the formal termination of the Consolidation Stage. 
</p>
<p>
	The territory of America is finalized. Individual US citizens become American Citizens. All statutes in the Legal Code marked "TR" (Transition Rule) are void. Grandfather clauses in the Legal Code meant to ease the transition are ended.
</p>
<p>
	The American State has applied for membership in international organizations under its own name. Agreements to uphold treaty obligations of the US during the transition period are terminated gracefully, with or without new treaties with the American State. Formal agreements with immediate neighbors and with more-distant foreign states have been signed. 
</p>
<p>
	The system is up and running.
