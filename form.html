<h1>Form of the State</h1>

<p>
With the establishment of the State, the previous format of the United States of America as a federation of quasi-autonomous states is dissolved. The historical friction between central power and states' rights is eliminated. 
</p>
<p>
The State constitutes the sole government of the nation. Any subdivisions of the government exist to serve regions or local areas more effectively than a very large and distant bureaucracy can do. Such subdivisions are not quasi-autonomous states, but <em>operating units</em> of the national government.
</p>
<p>
The people of the State have the right to vote. However, to mitigate the problems inherent in a wide-open democratic system, citizens who have a greater stake in the country have a proportionally greater voice in its government. 

Two levels of citizenship are defined: Full Citizenship and Basic Citizenship. Full Citizens are those who are fully invested in the system. Basic Citizens are those who choose, freely, to opt out of one or more tax-supported social services, or who lose Full Citizenship status for some other reason, such as a criminal conviction.Full Citizens are able to vote on matters of greater importance than Basic Citizens, and their votes carry more weight than those of Basic Citizens. 
</p>
<p>
Full Citizens are <em>required</em> to vote whenever a matter comes before the people for a vote. Failure to do so is a crime. Basic Citizens <em>may</em> vote if they so choose, whenever a matter comes before them for a vote. All citizens may circulate petitions, which the Decision Making Council must address if sufficient signatures are obtained. These are the ways in which the people express their will to the State.
</p>
<p>
Two classes of society are defined: the Professional Class and the Vocational Class. People who complete higher education through at least the Bachelor's level are considered Professional Class, unless they lose this status as a result of their own actions. Full Citizens of the Professional Class are eligible to serve in government, in law enforcement, as attorneys and judges, and as commissioned officers in the military. Their votes carry more weight than the votes of Full Citizens of the Vocational Class. This structure is a hedge against the kind of problem seen in the US with the 2016 national elections. 
</p>
<p>
The primary organs of the central government are a Decision Making Council and the National Advisory Board. 
</p>
<p>
The Decision Making Council comprises 15 members elected from the Professional Class who are required to rotate out of their positions on a staggered basis after serving no more than a defined term limit. This process is designed to minimize the chances of collusion or corruption, and to prevent anyone from amassing excessive personal power while serving on the Council.
</p>
<p>
The National Advisory Board comprises 1,000 individuals elected from the Professional Class who represent a wide range of different fields, with the mandate to apply their expertise to provide advice and oversight to the Decision Making Council. 
</p>
<p>
The details of membership in these two organs are described elswhere in these documents, but that is the general structure. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to the two primary organs of the State, an arbitrary number of <em>operating units</em> may be created to provide specific services to the people. 
</p>
<p>
The term <em>transfer</em> occurs in these documents. In context, <em>transfer</em> refers to the way things will happen in the transitional period when the country shuts down the United States and the individual states and begins to operate under the government of the State. Some governmental operations will carry over, as a practical matter; for example, driver license bureaus. However, all will be part of the sole central national government. 
</p>

<h2>Type of Government</h2>
<p>
We are at a loss to describe the State in terms of traditional political labels. 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
	It is not <em>totalitarian</em>, as the State does not "operate" the country centrally, and there is no individual leader.
</li>
<li>
	It is not <em>authoritarian</em>, as the purpose of the State is to <em>enable</em> rather than to <em>control</em> individual freedom, including the freedom of individuals who disagree with many of the central tenets of the system.</li>
<li>
	Although the Decision Making Council and the National Advisory Board are groups of people, the form is not an <em>oligarchy</em> as these groups are not affiliated through family or corporate connections, members are elected, and rotation of membership based on term limits is mandatory.
</li>
<li>
	Although membership in the Decision Making Council and the National Advisory Board is by election, it is not a <em>republic</em> as the elected members do not represent geographical areas or particular constituents, but rather are responsible for upholding human needs, human rights, legal rights, and the Three Pillars of Independence.
</li>
<li>
	Although citizens can vote on most matters, it is not <em>democratic</em>, as the system is protected from foolish decisions made by masses of uneducated or brainwashed people, as we have witnessed in the recent history of the US.
</li>
<li>
	Although significant decisions are made by the Decision Making Council, it is not a <em>parliamentary</em> system as that group does not operate by parliamentary rules or traditions.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The form of the State arose from conditions in the United States <em>circa</em> 2022 that were, at that time, leading to the steady deterioration and ultimate collapse of the country. Certain elements of the State's structure are designed to prevent similar deterioration in future. It is not based on any conventional political theory, so conventional political terminology does not quite fit.
</p>
<p>
Most elements of the State are based on observations of the behavior of US citizens over time. Where their behavior indicates an ability to make sound decisions, decision-making power is left to the people. Where their behavior indicates an inability to make sound decisions, decision-making power is claimed by the State. This is necessary, as recent history demonstrates how people can unwittingly threaten their own freedom by voting foolishly on important matters. 
</p>
<p>
The structure is neither arbitrary nor ideological. We think of it as practical. It recognizes the diversity of cultures and belief systems in the US and aims to provide a sustainable framework within which people can live as they see fit, provided they do not interfere with other people's ability to do the same. 
</p>
<p>
The structure of the State is designed to support its foundational principles - support for human needs, human rights, legal rights, and the Three Pillars of Independence. The only State-defined crimes are those that subvert human needs, human rights, legal rights, or the Three Pillars of Independence. Everything else is permitted by definition. It is, therefore, not an oppressive system. 
</p>

<h2>Not a Moderate System</h2>

<p>
The purpose of the State is to ensure human needs, human rights, and legal rights are upheld, and that the Three Pillars of Independence are supported so that the people's freedom can be assured over a long period of time. The purpose is <em>not necessarily</em> to avoid extremism. Where extremism is needed to support the <em>purpose</em> of the State, then extreme measures will be used. 
</p>
<p>
Anything that does not subvert human needs, human rights, legal rights, or the Three Pillars of Independence is allowed. Some may see that as extreme, as it allows other people to be different from themselves. Many in the US cannot tolerate anyone different from themselves. That attitude has severely damaged and weakened the country. That is, in fact, one of the main reasons we developed this model. It enables people to live as they choose, but not to interfere with <em>other</em> people's rights to live as <em>they</em> choose.
</p>
<p>
Anything that <em>does</em> subvert human needs, human rights, legal rights, or the Three Pillars of Independence is not only illegal, but will be dealt with very harshly. One result of this approach is there are very few crimes that call for moderate punishment. Most crimes call for much lighter punishment than under the current system, while more-serious crimes call for harsher punishment than under the current system. 
</p>
<p>
Minor crimes amount to poor choices on the part of an individual who still has a realistic chance to think about their behavior and change it. There is no payback for society for investing in the cost of incarceration for such crimes. 
</p>
<p>
The reason more-serious crimes are treated harshly that the <em>real crime</em> in those cases is the subversion of someone else's rights, one way or another. That is contrary to the fundamental values of the system and is not tolerated.
</p>
<p>
Minor crimes that do not involve violence usually result in fines, compensation for victims, or community service, but not incarceration. More-serious crimes call for incarceration and temporary reduction in citizenship status. 
</p>
<p>
Although the system is strict, there is no death penalty, as the <a href="what-are-human-rights.html">first human right is the right to exist</a>, and we consider human rights inviolable - they cannot be taken away by the State. However, in the case of forceful resistance to lawful arrest, death is a possible outcome. 
</p>
<p>
On a practical level, death in the course of resisting arrest is a natural consequence of forceful resistance to lawful authority. We will uphold the Three Pillars of Independence in whatever ways are necessary. This is the <em>function</em> of the State.
</p>
<p>
On a philosophical level, death in the course of resisting arrest represents an expression of individual liberty - the choice not to submit to authority, regardless of personal cost. We respect your freedom to choose. This is the <em>purpose</em> of the State.
</p>
<p>
Although the State is explicitly and intentionally designed to embrace the very different perspectives and belief systems various citizens hold, and to dictate nothing about what people "should" believe or think, when it comes to the foundational elements of the system there is no tolerance for variance. It is like a rigid framework within which considerable flexibility is possible. People are free to live in whatever ways they choose, short of causing harm to others; but the rigid part of the framework is definitive. Attempts to subvert it will be considered treason and will be strongly suppressed.
</p>
<p>
People are expected to accept the fact others may have different values than their own, and to live with that. They can enjoy their chosen lifestyles, but they cannot interfere with anyone else's chosen lifestyle. While there is great freedom to pursue different lifestyles, there is no freedom to contravene the fundamental values of the system. 
</p>

<p>
The choices are simple. When people feel strong disagreement with human rights, legal rights, or the Three Pillars of Independence, they are invited to place themselves wherever they please on the following diagram. They must find a way to live with their neighbors or find someplace else to live.
