<em>Contracts; Property; Probate</em>
</p>

<p>
12. Contracts.
<br/>
This section of the legal code concerns contracts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	12.1. Definitions.  
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	12.1.1. Contract. A <em>contract</em> is a legally-binding, written agreement between two parties. 
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	12.1.2. Party. A <em>party to a contract</em> is one of the signatories to the contract, having rights and obligations under the terms of the contract. 
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	12.1.3. Ordinary person. An individual who has not formally studied law. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	12.2. Contracts are to be written in clear and simple language that an ordinary person with a basic education is likely to understand. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	12.2.1. Corollary: There is some ambiguity in this statement, but the fact the <em>intent</em> of the law supersedes the <em>letter</em> of the law means people can use this Statute as a basis for interpretation of contracts and to help resolve conflicts regarding the terms of a contract and the performance of contractual obligations by the parties. Refer to Statute 1.4.7 for further explanation.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	12.2.2. Corollary: In case of a dispute over the wording of a contract, courts will consider whether the language of the contract is "tricky" and may void a contract if it seems to the court that the intent of one of the parties was to confuse the other party. This would be a violation of Statute 1.6.1 prohibiting abuse of the legal system.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	12.3. Accord and Satisfaction. When the original terms of a contract cannot be upheld for some reason, the parties may alter the original terms, even if only verbally. The <em>accord</em> is the new agreement between the parties, and <em>satisfaction</em> means the parties have acted consistently with the accord. In case of a breach of the modified terms, the original terms hold. Should the accord be satisfied, and one of the parties files suit against the other for breach of the original terms, the second party can demonstrate that the accord had been reached by showing evidence of satisfaction; that is, the plaintiff in the suit had acted on the revised terms (the accord). When the revised agreement is not made in writing, the behavior of the parties is the proof or disproof of the accord.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	12.4. Change of Heart.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	12.4.1. Any signatory to a contract may change their mind about the contract within three (3) business days of signing, and void the contract unilaterally. They need give no reason for their decision.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	12.4.2. In case of coercion or sales pressure to sign a contract immediately (for example, by offering a discounted price only if the customer signs today), the signatory with less power in the relationship (in a sales transaction, that is the customer) may change their mind about the contract within one (1) calendar month of the date of signing with no penalty. To offer such terms is a legal business practice, but it is also in an ethical gray area. Therefore, the State will tend to favor the party who has less power in the relationship. If the more-powerful party believes the less-powerful party is using the law to take advantage of them, they may challenge the decision in court. Anyone who abuses this law will be subject to prosecution under Statute 1.6.1, which prohibites abuse of the system for personal ends.
</p>

<p>
13. Property.
<br/>
This section of the legal code concerns real property and intellectual property.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	13.1. Definitions.  
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.1.1. Property. Something of value that is owned by a person or persons.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.1.2. Value. (a) An attribute of property that the property owner(s) considers desirable or useful; (b) The market price of a piece of property.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.1.3. Real property. A parcel of land, the natural resources on and beneath the land, natural growths (plants) on the land, and artificial improvements or structures attached to the land.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.1.4. Movable property or personal property. Items not attached to land that are owned by a person or persons.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.1.5. Intellectual property. The rights pertaining to an invention, creation, or innovation that is not of a physical nature. These rights include control over how information about the property may be shared with others, and the terms of use of the property by anyone other than its owner(s).
</p>


<p class="indent">
	13.2. Real property.  
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.2.1. TR: Initial Stability, Review, and Gradual Rationalization.
    <br/>
    Initially all existing national, state, county, and municipal laws regarding real property will remain in effect. The laws of the former US states will apply within the historical borders of those states. During the transition, the Government is directed to review real property law with the following aims and to update this Legal Code accordingly:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	<ul class="indent2">
		<li>eliminate any laws that are contrary to the fundamental goals of the State (human rights, legal rights, sustainable independence, individual liberty);</li>
		<li>consolidate laws that are redundant (state, county, municipal);</li>
		<li>identify laws that ought to remain unchanged within a former state's territory, for practical reasons; and</li>
		<li>simplify and modernize the wording of existing laws.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	Other statutes in Section 13.2 override and supersede corresponding provisions in US property law.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.2.2. Property Owner Associations (Homeowners Associations).
	<br/>
	Associations of this type will henceforth be called HOAs.
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	13.2.2.1. A developer may register an HOA with the Government to help maintain the projected sale prices for lots and homes in a new development. Purchasers will be required to comply with the HOA rules until 95% of the lots and homes have been sold. When 95% of the lots and/or homes have been sold, the HOA is dissolved. 
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	13.2.2.2. The Government is prohibited from mandating membership in an HOA except as provided in Statute 13.2.2.1.
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	13.2.2.3. Two or more property owners in a given development, community, or neighborhood may form an HOA to help them maintain common areas and for other common concerns. No owners in the same development, community, or neighborhood are required to join the HOA or to comply with its rules. Membership must be voluntary.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.2.3. Adverse possession is categorically prohibited.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.2.4. A property owner may do as they please on their own property, except actions that affect anyone else's ability to exercise their individual liberty, or that negatively affect anyone else's property values, or that undermines the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.2.5. Resource rights for assets naturally located beneath the surface belong to the property owner.
</p>

	13.2.5.1. Corollary: Operations to explore and/or extract underground resources <em>via</em> horizontal drilling must obtain permission from the owners of all parcels of land under which the drilling equipment will pass.
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	13.2.5.2. Corollary: If a hydraulic fracturing operation is initiated under land for which the operator has permission, and a fracture passes under land for which the operator does not have permission, the owner of the latter parcel may sue the operator for financial consideration.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.2.6. Air rights over land belong to the owner of that land up to an altitude of 400 meters (about 1,300 feet).
</p>

<p class="indent">
	13.3. Intellectual property.  
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	13.3.1. Patents.
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	13.3.1.1. TR: During the transition, the Government is directed to review US patent laws, procedures, and costs and to adjust such laws, procedures, and costs to bring them into alignment with the goal of the State to "establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty without external interference." Initially, existing US patent law will apply. As revised statutes are developed, they will be added to this section and will override or supercede the corresponding provisions in US law.
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	13.3.1.2. The patent holder may assign licensing terms and establish royalty amounts for the use of the work at their discretion, including the release of the work into the public domain.

</p>

<p class="indent3">
	13.3.1.5. When a patentable invention is created under "work for hire" terms using the facilities and resources of an employer or business client, the employer or business client owns the patent. Workers who expect to work on patentable inventions on behalf of an employer or business client may negotiate terms with said employer or business client for a share of royalties from use of the patented invention, before beginning work.

<p class="indent2">
	13.3.2. Copyrights.
