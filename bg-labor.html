<h1>Backgrounder on Employment and Labor</h1>

<p>
The State's position on the relationship between employers and workers is based on the duty of the State to establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty. Having rights defined in a document is a starting point, but we recognize that these things are meaningful only if people also have the practical means to act on their rights.

<h2>1. Employment and Labor in the US</h2>

<p>
As the target population for the State is the same as the population of the US, it may be instructive to review the history of labor in the US. Doing so may provide some insight or context about certain points that seem important to us because of our American upbringing. There is no need to go into depth here, as there is plenty of published material on the subject. 
</p>
<p>
Several of the original British colonies in North America were explicitly set up to be large-scale agricultural operations powered by chattel slavery. Throughout the colonies, nearly everyone who was not enslaved lived under economic conditions and under a legal system that ensured they would always live on the edge of starvation, and could never own property or have a voice in government. They were not permitted to strike for better working conditions. 
</p>
<p>
The authorities came down hard on striking workers, hiring other people living on the edge of starvation to break strikes using clubs and guns. This happened countless times from the earliest colonial days through the development of the United States over the next couple of centuries. 
</p>
<p>
Stories of "ironclad contracts" and "the company store" and unsafe working conditions and 16-hour work days and 6 or 7 day work weeks and child labor and sweatshops are well-known to anyone who has taken the time to look for them. They are not part of standard US public school curricula, but the information is out there for anyone who is interested.
</p>
<p>
The power elite have expended a great deal of money and effort to hold the general population down, when more effective methods of maintaining control and building wealth were available. We can only surmise those in the power elite <em>enjoyed</em> holding people down (and still do today), perhaps for psychological reasons that are out of scope for our purpose here. For some of them, the feeling of power may be worth more than the wealth they accrue.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the reasons or causes, with the State the systematic and deliberate oppression of workers comes to an end. This is a non-negotiable point.
</p>

<a name="laborrights"/>
<h2>2. Key Tenets of Labor Rights In the State</h2>

<p>
Our thinking on employment and labor arises naturally from an exploration of how to implement the State's purpose: to establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values, etc. How can Americans have the right (theory) and the ability (practice) to exercise individual liberty not only in the present moment, but indefinitely into the future? How do employment and labor issues play into that?
</p>
<p>
Clearly, no one has the practical ability to exercise their individual liberty if they are held down in an enforced condition of desperation, never being sure where they will sleep tonight or whether they will eat tomorrow. When the system enables infinite power by employers over employees, the employees are in just such a condition. Therefore, employers cannot have unlimited rights and power while their employees have none.
</p>
<p>
One might argue that the owner of a corporation is an individual American, just like each of their employees. What about the owner's rights? That person might wish to gather all the riches of the world and step all over other people in the process. That might be what they consider "freedom."
</p>
<p>
This is where Kindergarten Wisdom comes into play. One person's rights end where the next person's begin. The employer's rights end where the employee's begin. Applying utilitarian ethics to this topic, it seems to us that anything that moves the society closer to the State's purpose is "beneficial" for Americans and anything that moves the society further from the purpose is "harmful" to Americans. 
</p>
<p>
As a general standard, an honest day's work in exchange for a fair day's pay seems to us to be beneficial for Americans. Holding tens of millions in poverty in order to elevate 50 people to trillionaire status seems to us to be harmful. 
</p>
<p>
Can there be a "level playing field?" It seems unlikely. There is a natural power imbalance between a corporation that has the resources to create 10,000 jobs, and an individual worker looking for a job. Past attempts to implement ideas like "the workers control the means of production" have not resulted in improvements in the material living standards of workers. The workers <em>do not know how</em> to control the means of production, any more than the managers know how to make the product. To get anything done, the two have to work together.
</p>
<p>
If we cannot have a level playing field, then what is the next best thing? Possibly, having a system in place that defends human rights and legal rights, and that tries to make it possible for every American to enjoy freedom and opportunity, is the best we can hope for.
</p>

<a name="humanrights"/>
<h3>2.1. Human Rights Trump Contract Provisions</h3>

<p>
Throughout the description of the State system, we have reiterated that human rights are paramount. Having first defined "human" and then enumerated the rights we think every human has by virtue of their humanity, we place human rights above other considerations for determining what is "good" (moves the society closer to the goal state - sustainable individual liberty) or "bad" (moves the society further from the goal state).
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when companies require employees to sign contracts that include provisions contrary to the workers' human rights or legal rights, those provisions can be challenged in court and will be nullified if found to be in violation of human rights. For example, an employee agreement that requires arbitration under terms controlled by the employer, and prohibits employees from suing the employer individually or in a class action, are unlawful.
</p>

<a name="healthcare"/>
<h3>2.2. Healthcare Is Not Connected with One's Employer</h3>

<p>
In the present-day US, one of the key ways in which corporations maintain a feeling of uncertainty in the work force is by limiting their access to healthcare options. 
</p>
<p>
The US has no <em>bona fide</em> healthcare system at all (measured in terms of general access and cost to the consumer), notwithstanding the fine medical facilities and excellent healthcare professionals here. Instead, one must purchase private healthcare insurance, and then <em>hope</em> the insurance company will approve claims when you require medical services. The system is rigged such that you cannot know in advance whether your claims will be honored. Every time you get medical services, you are rolling the dice. You may or may not incur massive bills. You will not find out for months after you received services. This keeps people off balance and uncertain. 
</p>
<p>
On an individual level, the US system deprives people of the practical means to meet their deficiency needs. See the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a> for more on this subject.
</p>
<p>
The US system also degrades the general health of the work force as a whole, which would be treated under the State system as undermining the Three Pillars of Independence - a Category 1 crime. See the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-healthcare.html">Backgrounder on Healthcare</a> for more on the State's position on healthcare; the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-three-pillars.html">Backgrounder on the Three Pillars of Independence</a> for more information on that subject, and the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-crime.html">Backgrounder on Crime and Punishment</a> for more information on how the severity of a crime is determined.
</p>
<p>
Healthcare insurance in the US is available directly to consumers, but only those who are self-employed and pulling in sufficient revenue to pay the high costs are able to purchase it. Almost universally, working people must get healthcare insurance through their employers. If one comes down with a serious illness or has a long-term condition, they are in effect locked into their present job. Other companies will not accept them on their insurance rolls because they have "pre-existing conditions." This is wage slavery, and therefore a violation of human rights. See the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a> for an explanation of the State's position on human rights and an enumeration of the human rights the State recognizes.
</p>
<p>
Still another technique employers use to keep their employees off balance is to limit work hours to a level just below the legal definition of "full time," so that the employer will not be required to offer any benefits to their employees. Under a system in which employers are the middlemen between humans and healthcare services, it is not obvious how to establish a fair and practical way to provide healthcare options to people who work part time, and possibly multiple part time jobs. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, healthcare is defined as a human right and is provided through a single-payer system. That means private companies provide medical services, individuals and businesses pay taxes to support the services, and the government is the single payer for those services. It also means the government is responsible for setting quality standards and monitoring compliance. People can change jobs, work on gigs, work part time or full time, or any combination, without affecting their healthcare. The general health of the population is improved, which supports businesses both by ensuring a healthy work force is available, and by supporting the Three Pillars of Independence that make it possible for them to do business in the first place.
</p>
<p>
That is not the end of the story. The purpose of the State is to establish conditions that enable <em>all</em> Americans to live according to their own values. Americans hold a range of opinions about healthcare. Many Americans do not agree with the idea that healthcare is a human right. Under the State system, they are free to believe that, although they are not free to violate the human rights the State has defined. How do we propose to satisfy them, then?  
</p>
<p>
The answer is to divide the income tax into separate categories, and to allow individuals to opt out of categories they disagree with. Those who prefer not to help their fellow countrymen with healthcare can opt out of the healthcare tax. They are also opting out of healthcare services. Their philosophy of life is that people should take care of their own healthcare needs, so this solution aligns with what those Americans say they want. To us that means by definition they have no basis to complain about this solution. They can purchase private healthcare insurance and/or pay out of pocket for their own healthcare expenses. They can also opt back into the system at any time, if they change their minds. It is hard to imagine a more flexible or accommodating arrangement.
</p>


<a name="retirement"/>
<h3>2.3. Retirement (Pension) Is Not Connected with One's Employer</h3>

<p>
In the present-day US, many retirees must choose between buying food or medicine. We see this as an institutionalized violation of human rights. The State is prohibited from violating human rights, so we must come up with a system that "works."
</p>
<p>
Employers have offered retirement plans as a way to attract good employees and keep them from leaving. These plans typically build with tenure, creating an incentive for employees to remain with the company long enough to become fully vested in the plan. Over the years, other ways of providing for retirement income have been devised. In the Middle Ages in Europe, guilds would collect a small fee from members and pay out pensions when members became too old to work. In those days, the human lifespan was shorter than it is today, and this cost did not create a burden for the guilds. From the Industrial Era forward, labor unions also offered pension plans for members. Employee credit unions also did so. 
</p>
<p>
When employers control "too much" of employees' future financial options, the pension plan can become a tool similar to employer-managed healthcare plans to keep workers off balance and willing to work under questionable conditions for low pay.
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, one of the optional income taxes funds a retirement plan that is not connected with any employer. It is implemented differently than the US Social Security system, but would "feel" much the same to a retiree. The pension amount depends on how many years the individual paid into the system. 
</p>
<p>
The combination of this pension and the guaranteed minimum income is meant to be sufficient for a retiree to survive with a reasonable, although modest material standard of living. Combined with individual savings/investments and corporate pension plans (which are still expected to be offered as a way to compete for good employees), retirees will not be destitute. In keeping with our philosophy of free choice (see the <a href="bg-choice.html">Backgrounder on Choices and Consequences</a>), individuals who planned for their retirement could be set up nicely to enjoy that period of their lives. Those who failed to plan would, at least, not starve.
</p>
<p>
Those Americans who believe in self-sufficiency may opt out of the pension plan and the associated income tax category. They can opt back in again at any time, if they change their minds. This arrangement respects the different opinions/values of different Americans while enabling the maximum level of free choice for everyone.
</p>

<a name="minimumwage"/>
<h3>2.4. There Is a Livable Minimum Wage</h3>

<p>
In the present-day US there is a minimum wage, but it is too low to provide even a basic standard of living for people. In order to fulfill the duty to establish the conditions that enable Americans to take care of their human needs, the State must define a minimum wage that is sufficient to maintain a person at a reasonable, if modest, standard of living, when combined with the guaranteed minimum income. The minimum wage must be reviewed every few years and, possibly, adjusted in line with general economic changes. The details are a matter for statutory law. 
</p>

<a name="guaranteed"/>
<h3>2.5. There Is an Optional Guaranteed Minimum Income</h3>

<p>
Some places around the world have implemented the idea of a guaranteed minimum income in one form or another, with mixed results. In some cases, it enabled people to pursue personal interests and led to creativity and innovation, with positive economic impact. In other cases, it enabled a large part of the population to live "on the dole" and not work at all. Unfortunately, we cannot be sure what the effect of this would be in America. 
</p>
<p>
Initially, the intent is to implement a guaranteed minimum income and observe the effects. Based on those observations, the State will make adjustments to discover a workable and beneficial system - or eliminate the guarantee, if that is where the data lead us.
</p>
<p>
In any case, many Americans are philosophically opposed to the concept. For that reason, this benefit will be funded through an optional income tax category. Americans will be able to opt in or out on an annual basis, as many times as they please.
</p>

<a name="execcap"/>
<h3>2.6. Individual Executive Compensation is Capped</h3>

<p>
As a mechanism to control the wealth gap (see the <a href="bg-wealth-gap.html">Backgrounder on the Wealth Gap</a>), individual compensation for work will be capped as a function of (a) the minimum wage and (b) the financial condition of the company. Factor (a) is meant to help control the wealth gap in the interest of <em>sustainability</em>. Factor (b) is meant to reward business leaders who drive financial success for their companies.  
</p>
<p>
This inevitably leads to the question, "How much is enough?" We do not think there is an objective answer to the question. Can a person live just as comfortably with $10 million personal worth as on $100 million or $1 billion? Probably, they can. What more could you possibly buy, that you couldn't buy with $10 million? 
</p>
<p>
But to the person who is earning or generating the money, there is no upper limit. They will claim the possibility of building personal wealth is their incentive for doing what they do. But, in view of Daniel Pink's work, is that really the case? 
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, one well-known billionaire is Elon Musk. He has founded or co-founded several successful businesses, and with the proceeds of selling his stake in one of them he started two successful companies: Tesla and Space-X. His personal vision is for humanity to become a multiplanetary species. He has his sights set on Mars as the first extraterrestrial planet to have a permanent human population.
</p>
<p>
Under the present US system, nearly all the money generated by the two companies goes directly to him, personally. Under the State system, that money would belong to the companies, and his personal income would be capped by the minimum-wage-plus-financial-condition formula, the details of which are out of scope here. Would this eliminate his incentive to help humanity become an interplanetary species? We think not. That goal is not about money. In fact, money is only a means to that end. Under the State system, the money would still be there, and the goal would still be there, and the individual driving toward the goal would still be there. He would be quite wealthy on a personal level, probably having more money than he could ever spend. His material lifestyle would be no different. And the day-to-day lives of those who might oppose compensation caps on principle would be exactly the same as they are today, if not better.  
</p>
<p>
Our observation is that the people who complain about compensation caps are not the Musks of the world, but ordinary Americans who have almost no realistic chance of "hitting the jackpot" themselves, and almost none of whom have a vision like Musk's or the personal drive to realize such a vision. Why, then, do they object? We think the reasons have to do with the myth of the self-made man and the tendency for Americans to conflate financial worth with the value of a human being as such. See the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-american-characteristics.html">Backgrounder on the Characteristics of Americans</a> for more on that subject. 
</p>
<p>
We do not consider this realistic, and certainly not worth undermining the quality of life for the majority of Americans to maintain extreme wealth for the few. We need not answer the question "How much is enough?" to reach that conclusion.
</p>

<a name="laborunions"/>
<h3>2.7. Labor Unions Are Legal, But Regulated</h3>

<p>
Although we have done our best to design a system that will be fair for all, there will inevitably be conflicts between labor and management. Even given the protections built into the State system, large employers have considerably more capability than any individual worker. The need for labor unions will still exist.
</p>
<p>
Anyone can elaborate a political-economic model in theory. Once a model is implemented in reality, it is subject to all the creativity, ambition, greed, and trickery of real humans who do not have a personal interest in seeing the model succeed. The State system has some defenses built-in - the emphasis on human rights, the checks and balances of the governmental structure, the focus on sustainability, protections against mass stupidity in the voting booth, yet still supporting voting rights and petition rights. But people will still find ways to try and exploit the system for their own gain. 
</p>
<p>
One way this happens in real life is that different power centers collude or cooperate in some way. What are the risks when we consider the interplay among three power centers: Business, government, and labor? When business and government are too closely aligned, labor suffers. The cooperation between large-scale capitalists and government during the Industrial Revolution in the US is an example. When government and labor are too closely aligned, the result is often excessive regulation and bureaucracy that inhibits innovation. Government-operated labor unions in Europe, at the time of writing, are examples of this problem. When business and labor are too closely aligned (read: labor leaders have been bought and paid for by business), the effect is the same as if workers had no protection from abuse.
</p>
<p>
When either business interests or the government override labor interests, people suffer. This has happened repeatedly in communist countries and in fascist countries throughout the 20th century up to the present. When labor unions become too powerful, the general economy can suffer, with repercussions for ordinary people. This happened with the growth of certain unions in the US in the 20th century, such as the Teamsters, which for a time operated in much the same way as the Mafia.
</p>
<p>
The State's role must be to define legislation that sets boundaries and standards for labor relations, but the State must not be connected with labor unions or with business interests in a formal way. Both business and organized labor must be free to operate as they see fit, within the law. 
</p>

<a name="protest"/>
<h3>2.8. The Right of Protest is a Legal Right</h3>

<p>
The State defines the right of protest as a legal right. A legal right is inviolable, like a human right. The difference is that legal rights are not a natural part of one's humanity. They define the relationship between individuals and "authority," be it State authority or any other - corporations, religions, labor unions, etc. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, one mechanism available to workers who believe they are being treated unfairly is to protest in public. This can include marches, rallies, picket lines, and other peaceful forms of expression both in person and in cyberspace. The goal is usually to sway public opinion in their favor, with the expectation that the "authority" in question will not want to have a negative reputation with the general public, and will negotiate in good faith.
</p>

<a name="picketing"/>
<h3>2.9. Picketing May Be Done Wherever It Is Effective, Not Only at Job Sites</h3>

<p>
This may be a corollary to the previous point, but it bears calling out because of the situation in the present-day US. The law allows companies to limit labor protests to the particular job site where abuses are reputedly happening. In many cases, this keeps the protesters well away from the public eye, and limits their impact.
</p>
<p>
In our view, workers have the full right to bring public attention to their cause by protesting or picketing wherever it makes sense - including the headquarters of the company that is accused of labor abuses on remote job sites.
</p>
<p>
There is a limiting factor - the sanctity of the home is defined as a human right, and human rights trump everything else. Therefore, picketing or protesting in front of someone's private home is illegal under the State system - even if the protester's shoes are technically touching ground that lies outside the property line, as the intent of the activity is to disrupt the personal lives of the people who live there. Remember the importance of <em>intent</em> in State law.
</p>

<a name="paidleave"/>
<h3>2.10. Workers Have Rights to Sick Leave, Vacation Time, and Parental Leave</h3>

<p>
In keeping with the State's duty to establish conditions for Americans to <em>live</em>, as opposed to merely <em>existing</em> like animals or resources, we establish guarantees for paid sick leave, vacation time, and parental leave. This does increase operating costs for companies, but most companies already squeeze workers as hard as they can to maximize profit, well beyond the point of diminishing returns. 
</p>

<a name="transparency"/>
<h3>2.11. Compensation Transparency</h3>

<p>
In the present-day US, one of the main methods to keep workers off-balance and uncertain where they stand is to say that compensation is confidential. Most workers in most companies can be fired immediately if they discuss their own compensation or reveal anyone else's. 
</p>
<p>
To help level the playing field, under the State system everyone's compensation, in all its forms, must be public information. 
</p>


<a name="workerduties"/>
<h2>3. The Duties of Workers</h2>

<p>
This document probably appears to be heavily weighted in favor of workers over employers. The reason is that employers naturally hold most of the power in the relationship, and historically they have systematically and consistently abused that power. Consistent with our views on <a href="bg-choice.html">choices and consequences</a>, the State's labor laws are a <em>natural consequence</em> of powerful business leaders' <em>choices</em> throughout US history. 
</p>
<p>
But there are expectations for both sides in any relationship. Employer-worker relations are no different.
</p>
<p>
Workers are expected to follow their employers' rules and adhere to the particulars of their employment agreement or contract. They should not have to "fight" for human rights and legal rights as they have done in the past, as employers are already required to uphold those things, and the terms of employment are not permitted to subvert anyone's rights. 
</p>
<p>
An employee has the duty to have the skills they claim to have upon hiring, and to be responsible for their own career development and ongoing learning. Employers may provide training or education, but they are within their rights to limit these things to training that is required for an employee's <em>present position</em>. Employers are not responsible for the employee's career; that is, preparing them for their next job. Employers are <em>free</em> to do so if they so choose, either to prepare employees for advancement within their company, to provide an attractor or incentive to stay with the company, or as a general principle they believe in. 
</p>
<p>
An employee has the duty to show up for work at the times and places designated by their employer, and to be in proper condition to work - sober, rested, qualified, equipped, and ready. They have the duty to stay home when sick, to avoid infecting co-workers. They have the responsibility to manage their own career growth - that is, considerations beyond their present job, such as ongoing education and practicing skills that they use in their work.
