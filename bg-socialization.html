<h1>Backgrounder on Socialization and Civics</h1>

<p>
<em>Socialization</em> is the process of guiding people in understanding and applying social norms and customs. A related concept, often called <em>political socialization</em>, is an aspect of a country's educational system that aims to instill love of country and patriotism in young people. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Civics</em> is the name of a school subject in the US in which children learn about the structure and operation of government - how a bill becomes law, how to cast a vote, and so forth.

<h2>1. Problems In the US <em>circa</em> 2022</h2>

<p>
In the current education system in the US, socialization and civics have largely been eradicated due to the steady influence of "liberals" in education over a period of decades. 
</p>
<p>
In the middle of the 20th century, it was common for children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of the school day, and many schools had morning and afternoon ceremonies for raising and lowering the national flag. Those activities are examples of <em>political socialization</em>.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, civics classes were a standard part of the public school curriculum in the middle of the 20th century. Children learned about the structure and operation of the federal government and their own state's government. 
</p>
<p>
It is arguable that political socialization was taken to an extreme. For example, US history courses in public schools omitted the unpleasantries of US history and overstated - or simply made up - the heroism and nobility of the white European conquerors of the New World. 
</p>
<p>
This was never necessary. A positive attitude about the country can be encouraged on the basis of truth, provided the appropriate context is given and people have the opportunity to discuss the issues; and, of course, assuming the nation is actively and mindfully pursuing its own social development and improvement.
</p>
<p>
In correcting for the overzealous nationalism in school curricula, liberals went too far in the other direction. The result is a population who are ambivalent about their country, if not downright hostile toward it. 
</p>
<p>
As of 2022, the country is divided broadly into two groups - one who think the country is categorically "bad," and one who misunderstand "patriotism" to mean "anything goes" in the name of God and country. Each group believes the other to be subversive and treasonous. Neither attitude is based on objective reality. Both are dangerous and self-destructive.

<h2>2. Socialization in the State Educational System</h2>

<p>
Socialization mainly concerns instilling respect for human rights and individual responsibility in young people. The purpose of the State is to serve as a framework within which people can live according to their own choices freely and peacefully. For this to be true, the majority of people must recognize and respect the rights of others as equal to their own. 
</p>
<p>
This contrasts with US culture <em>circa</em> 2022, in which people assume the only way they can "win" is if someone else "loses."
</p>
<p>
Socialization is not a class in the curriculum. It is an ongoing process of inculcating fundamental values. Situations that come up in the normal course of life offer "teaching moments" to reinforce understanding and behaviors.
</p>
<p>
There is (as of 2022) a series of videos on YouTube in which experts explain a topic at five different levels - child, teen, university student, adult, and expert. Socialization in the State educational system takes a cue from these videos. The fundamental values are expressed in different ways for different age groups, depending on what they are ready to understand and what we can expect them to be accountable for understanding. As of this writing, we have three levels.
</p>

<a name="pattern"/>
<h3>2.1. Socialization: General Pattern</h3>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Individual liberty and individual responsibility are interrelated.</li>
	<li>The Golden Rule.</li>
	<li>The spirit of the law trumps the letter of the law.</li>
	<li>What to do when someone doesn't follow these guidelines.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a name="child"/>
<h3>2.2. Socialization: Child</h3>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>You can do the things you want to do as long as you don't hurt anyone else and you have your parents' permission.</li>
	<li>If you want to be treated fairly, you have to treat others fairly, too.</li>
	<li>Rules exist to help us treat others fairly. Usually, following the rules is the right thing to do. But when you think following a rule would hurt someone, you can break the rule. If you aren't sure what to do, ask an older person for help. If there is no time to ask someone, do what seems right to you. You are a good person and you can trust yourself.</li>
	<li>Some people do not understand what it means to be fair with others. When someone is unfair with you more than once, even when you give them a second chance, it is a good idea to avoid them. If they will not leave you alone, ask an adult for help.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a name="teen"/>
<h3>2.3. Socialization: Adolescent/Teen</h3>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>You are mature enough to understand what human rights and legal rights are and why they are important. You are meeting new people, learning new ideas, and experimenting with new activities and skills. This is the time to try new things and discover your interests. You may find that sometimes the things you want to do would interfere with someone else's life. That is a boundary or limit. None of us can cross that boundary. You may not always like or approve of every kind of person you meet or learn about, but each of them has the same rights as you.</li>
	<li>You want the freedom to do the things you want to do. So does everyone else. Respect other people's rights, and they will respect yours. Disrespect other people's rights, and you might be subject to legal penalties.</li>
	<li>Testing the boundaries of life is part of growing up. As you experiment with life you will discover the practical and legal limits of individual liberty, sometimes by observation and sometimes by your own direct experience. Remember that most rules are in place to help people avoid problems. But there are circumstances when someone's human rights would be violated if we followed a rule blindly, without considering context or circumstances. This is a time for you to develop good judgment about when it is appropriate to bend or break a rule. Some rules, or laws, are very serious and violating them will have consequences beyond your childhood. Those are the laws that pertain to the Three Pillars of Independence. Be careful to follow those laws. Otherwise, use Kindergarten Wisdom and your knowledge of human rights to guide your decisions about interactions with other people.</li>
	<li>You will encounter people who do not yet understand the first three points, or who have intentionally decided not to follow those guidelines. You do not have to defend yourself against such people alone. When someone treats you unfairly, bullies you, or assaults you, notify an adult. This will not reflect on your courage or personal strength. Using the system to maintain order is the appropriate way to deal with these problems.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a name="adult"/>
<h3>2.4. Socialization: Adult</h3>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Your rights end where the next person's rights begin. You can do as you please provided you don't interfere with anyone else's ability to do as <em>they</em> please. Your approval is not required for someone else to differ from you by nature, by belief, or by choice.</li>
	<li>When anyone is oppressed, no one is free. Your individual liberty depends on defending and upholding everyone's individual liberty, including people with whom you disagree. When a large number of people take advantage of others, it causes the authorities to increase general policing and law enforcement activity, which intrudes on your freedom. To avoid that outcome, treat others properly. Regulate your own behavior in accordance with the principles of human rights. The State will defend human rights in any case. It will be better for everyone if you don't force it to be done the "hard way."</li>
	<li>Laws and regulations are meant to help us navigate common situations in life. In some cases, following a law to the letter would violate someone's human rights. When you must make this kind of choice, err on the side of human rights. Use your best judgment. If you make a mistake, your good intentions will be considered in judging your case.</li>
	<li>Some people will try to take advantage of the system, no matter what the system is. They will try to take advantage of you when your circumstances are unfavorable. When you learn that someone is that way, avoid having any dealings with them. Gradually, they will become ostracized. This will give them a chance to reconsider their behavior. In extreme cases, their behavior may include theft, vandalism, or violence. If they break the law, report them. People who actively do harm must be removed from society to protect you and others.</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Civics In the State Educational System</h2>

<p>
Civics is a set of courses in the basic curriculum. They provide students with information about:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>The purpose, structure, and operation of the State government apparatus.</li>
	<li>A citizen's responsibilities with respect to the State.</li>
	<li>The State's responsibilities to the people.</li>
	<li>How a citizen can participate in government.</li>
	<li>Understanding the Constitution.</li>
	<li>The circumstances that prompted the creation of the State, and how the State is meant to solve or alleviate those problems.</li>
	<li>The function of law enforcement in society.</li>
	<li>What to do if you must interact with law enforcement personnel.</li>
	<li>Your rights and the expected procedures for law enforcement's interaction with you, and your legal recourse in case those rights and procedures are not honored.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
These topics are presented in different ways for different age groups. The information about law enforcement and about the history leading to the creation of the State is not presented to younger children.

<h2>4. Socialization and Civics for Immigrants</h2>

<p>
Immigrants and long-term legal residents of the country must understand the expected societal norms and the laws of the land. The State and private companies will offer training sessions to help adult immigrants adapt to life in their adopted country.
