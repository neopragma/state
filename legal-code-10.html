<em>Labor and Compensation</em>
</p>

<p>
10. Labor and Compensation.
<br/>
This section of the legal code concerns labor-management relations, compensation, and control of the wealth gap.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.1. For purposes of calculating minimum and maximum compensation levels, the standard full-time work week is four (4) days of eight (8) hours each, and the standard work year consists of 50 weeks. This statute does not dictate the work hours or days per week; it only sets a standard for calculations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   10.2. The State is directed to establish and enforce a minimum hourly wage that can support a person at a modest material standard of living based on cost of living considerations and assuming the standard full-time work week. The State will assess the minimum wage every two (2) years and adjust it as necessary to keep it aligned with changes in the cost of living. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.2.1. Corollary: For occupations that are paid on a flat salary basis, the minimum annual salary will be the minimum hourly wage multiplied by 1,600 hours, reflecting the definition of full-time work according to statute 10.1. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.2.2. Corollary: Independent workers and contractors may negotiate forms of compensation not based on time worked, as may be agreeable between the worker and client. Calculation of the maximum annual income will still be based on the minimum wage.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   10.3. The maximum individual annual income, including all forms of compensation and personal profit, is fifty (50) times the minimum annual salary as specified in statute 10.2.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.3.1. A year of income is calculated from the tax filing deadline of one year until the tax filing deadline of the following year. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.3.2. When an individual's income exceeds the annual limit, the individual may choose (a) to contribute all or part of the excess amount to a charity or charities of their choice; or (b) to have all or part of the excess amount credited to their company or employer; or (c) to have all or part of the excess amount saved in the general fund for government operations, under their own name for purposes of recovery in future years; or (d) any combination of (a), (b), and (c). 
</p>

<p class="indent3">
    <em>Note:</em> Option (a) is useful for individuals who want to reduce their tax liability by using charitable contributions to offset taxable income. Option (b) is useful for company owners or corporate executives who want their excess income to strengthen the company's financial reserves. Option (c) is expected to be the typical choice for individuals.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	10.3.3. When an individual's income falls below the annual limit and they have contributed excess income from previous years into the general fund, they may elect to receive payments from that fund to level up their income to the lesser of (a) the annual income cap or (b) the amount they have contributed to the fund. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.3.4. Excess income contributed to the general fund will earn interest for the taxpayer at a rate the lesser of (a) 1% per annum or (b) the prime rate as of the most recent tax filing deadline date. The interest earned counts toward the individual's annual income limit.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.4. Workers have the right to organize.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.4.1. Labor unions must be independent of both (a) the government and (b) employers.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.4.2. Workers will not be restricted from organizing.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.4.3. Workers will not be compelled to join a labor union.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.4.4. Workers have the right to strike individually or to join a strike organized by a labor union even if they do not belong to a labor union.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.4.5. Protests and pickets can be done in any location where workers feel they will be effective, except anyone's private homes. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.5. All compensation information is public information.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.6. Employers with more than four (4) employees must provide vacation time at full pay, of frequency and duration negotiated between the worker and the employer, but not to less than two weeks per year. Terms such as minimum service to qualify for vacation time and whether vacation time can be carried over into subsequent years are matters for negotiation. If a labor union is in place and the worker is a member of the union, such negotiation may be between the union and the employer.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.7. Employers with more than four (4) employees must provide paid sick leave at no less than 80% of full pay, of a minimum duration of two weeks per year and of maximum duration negotiated between the worker and the employer. If a labor union is in place and the worker is a member of the union, such negotiation may be between the union and the employer.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.8. Employers with more than twenty (20) employees must provide paid parental leave at no less than 75% of full pay, for a minimum duration of three (3) months and a maximum duration negotiated between the worker and the employer, with the guarantee the employee can return to the job afterwards. 

</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.8.1. If a labor union is in place and the worker is a member of the union, such negotiation may be between the union and the employer. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.8.2. In the case when both parents are employed with the same company, the required parental leave applies to one (1) of the parents. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.8.3. Employees and employers may negotiate terms more favorable to the employees, but not less favorable terms than the statutory minimums. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.8.4. The State will partially subsidize the wage/salary cost for parental leave based on the statutory minimum parental leave time. The details are specified at the regulatory level, not the statutory level.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.9. Employers with more than four (4) and fewer than twenty-one (21) employees must provide parental leave for a minimum duration of three (3) months and a maximum duration negotiated between the worker and the employer, with the guarantee the employee can return to the job afterwards. Such leave may be unpaid, but a level of compensation may be negotiated between the worker and the employer. If a labor union is in place and the worker is a member of the union, such negotiation may be between the union and the employer.
</p> 

<p class="indent">
	10.10. Employers with more than twenty (20) employees must provide day care services for the children of employees, either by (a) paying the employee an additional amount to cover the cost of day care services; or (b) paying directly for third-party day care services; or (c) collaborating with other small employers to provide day care services; or (d) establishing day care facilities on premises. The State will partially subsidize the cost for day care services.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.11. Independent workers may pool their resources to pay for day care services. The State will partially subsidize the cost of such day care services. Subsidy amounts are defined at the regulatory level, not the statutory level.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	10.12. Larger employers may offer access to their on-premise day care services to employees of smaller enterprises and/or to independent workers for a fee. They will be eligible for the State subsidy based on the total number of people served.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	10.13. TRAP protection. Training Repayment Agreement Provisions (TRAPs) in employment or contract work agreements are considered a form of wage slavery. Regardless of how phrased, such provisions will automatically be deemed (a) severable and (b) null and void. Attempts to enforce such provisions will be deemed Category 1 offenses, as they have the effect of creating a permanent underclass, which degrades the country's ability to maintain sustainable independence and freedom for the people.
