</p>
<h1>What are human rights?</h1>
<p>
Human rights are fundamental rights to which all people are entitled by virtue of the fact they are human beings. These are rights no government can grant or withhold; they are unconditional because they are part of human nature.
</p>
<p>
We recognize the following as <em>human rights</em>.
</p>

<h2>1. Everyone has the right to exist.</h2>	

<p>
This may seem rather obvious, but unfortunately people's right to live has not always been upheld. There are many instances in human history of genocides and attempted genocides. In some societies, individuals consider it their right to kill others; sometimes for business reasons, sometimes in connection with organized criminal activities such as drug trafficking, sometimes to silence a political opponent or a person who "knows too much" about a situation that may have negative consequences for the killer. 
</p>
<p>
In some cases, people kill simply because they feel like it. In a case in the US in 2021, a criminal escaping the scene of a crime drove through a holiday parade, intentionally striking pedestrians in the parade. He injured around 40 people and killed several. At around the same time, also in the US, a driver in an illegal street race crashed into a car uninvolved in the race and killed the driver. In hundreds of cases per year, someone in the US opens fire on a crowd of people in a school, a shopping center, a concert venue, or a place of worship for no real reason. 
</p>
<p>
Others around the world carry out acts of violence to make a political statement or to express their hatred of those who do not follow the same religion. Terrorists kill large numbers of people in crowded places such as markets and schools, on public transportation facilities, and in buildings for reasons unconnected with their victims. 
</p>
<p>
The 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states, in Article 3, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person." The 1776 US Declaration of Independence states, "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness..."
</p>
<p>
Similarly, we recognize the simple right to exist as the first and most fundamental human right. Therefore, it follows that when we are defining crimes and penalties, denying someone their right to exist must rank as the single most serious crime, deserving of the most serious penalty. 
</p>

<h2>2. Human rights are unconditional.</h2>

<p>
Human rights are part of human nature; they are unconditional. This also may seem rather obvious, but unfortunately, people have denied basic human rights to others simply because they are different from themselves. It is therefore necessary to state this explicitly.
</p>
<p>
Article 2 of the UDHR states, in part, "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status." Over time, the Constitution of the United States has been amended to state, explicitly, that one or another category of people is entitled to basic rights - see the 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments.
</p>
<p>
The fact it has been necessary to spell out all the different categories of humans who are entitled to basic human rights, again and again over a period of centuries, indicates that people will not respect one another automatically or naturally. It is a learned behavior that must be taught, monitored, and enforced.
</p>
<p>
Our view is that a human is a human. Individuals differ - by birth, circumstance, or choice - but all have human rights by nature, unconditionally. No one requires anyone else's approval to be entitled to full human rights. 
</p>
<p>
The life span of a human consists of continuous development and change. To be fair, human rights must apply at all points in this life span. In order to ensure fairness in the context of family, individual legacy, and similar matters, and to provide appropriate protection to those who cannot defend their own rights, especially at the extreme beginning and end of their life spans, it seems reasonable to extend the period when a person is recognized as "human" before physical birth and after physical death, to some extent. We have <a href="what-is-human.html">addressed this topic in a separate document</a>. Humans who meet the definition of "human" as expressed therein are considered eligible for full human rights under the proposed system of government.
</p>




<h2>3. People will not be held in bondage.</h2>

<p>
It is not possible for a person to pursue happiness, fulfillment, or achievement in life if they are owned like a piece of property, either literally or as a practical effect of circumstances beyond their control, such as economic status or societal power balance. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we consider individual freedom to be a fundamental human right - necessary to ensure other rights are upheld. In keeping with our understanding of the words, <em>freedom</em> and <em>bondage</em>, the implication is that people must have realistic and practical ways to exercise this right, or else it is meaningless - or worse, it is a <em>tease</em> - "Yes, technically you have the right to X, but there's no practical way for you to do it, ha ha!" 
</p>
<p>
Of course, this pertains to the more usual sense of "bondage," as well. It includes slavery, wage slavery, human trafficking, and similar activities.
</p>
<p>
To be meaningful, freedom has to be a practical reality for everyone, and not merely a word the powerful use to oppress everyone else.
</p>

<h2>4. The physical security of a person's home will be respected.</h2>

<p>
In the US, it's common for law enforcement personnel to break into a residence without a warrant and without warning, often with guns blazing - and almost as often, they have the wrong address. We assert it is a fundamental human right for people to feel secure in their own homes.
</p>
<p>
There will be legal procedures to enter residences when there is reason to suspect criminal activity. There will be no arbitrary entry into people's homes. 
</p>
<p>
Another source of insecurity comes from criminals who invade homes to terrorize and kill the people inside or to burgle homes they they believe to be unoccupied. The legal penalties for such activities will be severe enough to provide a deterrent to such crimes. If the deterrent effect is not sufficient, then criminals who specialize in these activities will gradually be removed through prosecution of their crimes. 
</p>
<p>
The most basic definition of "home" is the place where a person sleeps at night. For purposes of this right, we understand "home" to include the property surrounding the residential structure, if it is owned or rented by the resident, and personal conveyances such as privately-owned automobiles, which we consider to be extensions of the individual's home. 
</p>

<h2>5. No one will be arbitrarily detained, beaten, tortured, or denied basic needs.</h2>

<p>
Many governments around the world routinely detain people without charges and do anything they please to the detainees with no oversight and no concern for human rights. This must be explicitly forbidden in the State or abuses will almost certainly occur.
</p>
<p>
The US, for all its imperfections, does not have this problem to the same degree as many other countries have. There are some cases when detainees are abused, but this seems to be far more common with dictatorships than democracies.
</p>
<p>
There have been exceptions in the US. Years ago, the Chicago police department maintained a location they used to interrogate suspects "off the books," without following due process. It was, in effect, a torture chamber. In New York City, also years ago, it was common for police officers to assault "known" criminals when off duty and not in uniform. The Los Angeles police department is notorious for harsh treatment of suspects, contrary even to their own operating rules. Smaller police and sheriff departments around the country have probably gotten away with inhumane treatment of suspects for many years, as they are small enough to operate without attracting much notice beyond the local area.
</p>
<p>
In principle, this right is similar to UDHR Article 9, which reads, "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."
</p>
<p>
The Family Separation Policy enacted in the US in 2017 is an example of arbitrary exile. The children of refugees were separated from their families and the families were deported from the US. The program was operated in such a way as to ensure there was no practical way for the parents ever to find their children again. This was defended as a "border control" policy, intended to deter other refugees from seeking asylum in the US. We consider it a crime against humanity. 
</p>

<h2>7. Everyone is entitled to due process of law.</h2>

<p>
Legal rights are not at the same level as human rights; they are conditional on a person living up to their duties and obligations to the society in which they live. However, the right to fair treatment before the law is a fundamental human right. Regardless of the nature of the crime, every suspect has the right to fair treatment and trial. 
</p>
<p>
In the US, it is often the case that a suspect is killed outright long before they have had the opportunity to speak with legal counsel or to be tried in court before a jury of their peers. More often than not, it is law enforcement personnel who carry out the killing. That situation has been one of the drivers for the present effort to define a better system. 
</p>
<p>
This is similar to UDHR Articles 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, and in part, Article 9. The fact similar rights had to be defined in six different Articles underscores the fact this has been a common factor in many societies and governments.
</p>

<h2>8. Presumption of innocence.</h2>

<p>
Anyone accused of a crime will be assumed innocent unless their guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt in a court of law. 
</p>
<p>
This is not a reaction to the situation in the US, as the country already has the principle of presumption of innocence. However, most other countries assume the accused is guilty; apparently, they reason that the police would not bother with the necessary paperwork for an arrest unless they were almost certain the person was guilty. Even countries we generally assume are civilized and democratic have the presumption of guilt, including Italy, Spain, and Japan. 
</p>

<h2>9. Timeliness of legal proceedings.</h2>

<p>
Anyone accused of a crime will have their case heard in a timely manner. Accusation will not be used as an excuse for arbitrary detention. The details of how long a detainee may be held without charge and how long an accused may be held before trial are matters for statutory law.
</p>

<h2>10. Immediate release when conviction is overturned.</h2>

<p>
A person wrongly convicted of a crime will be released immediately if it is later determined that someone else actually committed the crime. 
</p>
<p>
This is a reaction to the situation in the US whereby a person who has served many years in prison due to a false conviction must remain incarcerated while various lengthy legal procedures are carried out to secure their release.
</p>

<h2>11. The right of self defense.</h2>

<p>
Everyone has the right to defend their own lives and the lives of others around them when an immediate physical threat exists, using the level of force necessary to resolve the situation. 
</p>
<p>
This does not apply to criminals who want to "defend themselves" against arrest by duly authorized law enforcement operatives.
</p>

<h2>12. The right to reasonable living conditions.</h2>

<p>
The right to exist means little if existence is miserable. Therefore, everyone has the natural human right to a defined minimum material standard of living. It is a responsibility of the State to organize funding to deliver this to the people.
</p>
<p>
The proposed form of government described in these documents suggest this right can be supported through a combination of (a) universal basic health care, (b) guaranteed minimum income, and (c) retirement accounts. Additional ideas for supporting this right are possible, welcome, and encouraged. 
</p>
<p>
This right is also supported, in part, by regulations governing the quality of air, water, food, and medicines, as well as tenets of the Three Pillars of Independence that assure the State's ability to deliver these benefits sustainably.
</p>
<p>
This right is similar to UDHR Articles 24 and 25.
