<h1>Backgrounder on the Physical Territory of America</h1>

<h2>Initial Composition</h2>

<p>
	The physical territory of America differs from that of the present-day US. It may change further, as people living in various regions choose to join or leave the new country. As a starting point, we define American territory as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>All US states as of the date of the <a href="tr-stages.html">Public Approval Stage</a> of the <a href="transition.html">Transition Plan</a>, except the Confederacy (see below).</li>
		<li>The District of Columbia</li>
		<li>All US territories and other holdings</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	US states have a mixed history. Some were founding members of the United States. Some joined by free choice. Others were purchased from colonial powers that had conquered and occupied them. A few were taken by military force. We do not intend to sift through history and attempt to right all past wrongs. The present-day states except as noted above will be taken as the initial territory of America by default.
</p>
<p> 
	The State will define peaceful procedures to make adjustments to American territory after the State has been established, but no violent disruptions to the Transition will be tolerated. 
</p>

<h2>US Territories</h2>

<p>
	With regard to US territories, the State treats them differently based on whether they have permanent civilian populations.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Organized territories and American Samoa - the residents will choose whether to become part of the new America or to become independent countries. The organized territories are those that have permanent, non-military populations. They include Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition to these, American Samoa has a permanent civilian population, but is not "organized" according to the US Constitution. Because it has a permanent civilian population, the State considers it in this group.</li>
		<li>Unorganized territories have no permanent civilian populations. Initially, they will remain under American control as military bases. These include Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Wake Island, and Navassa Island.</li>
		<li>The US science stations in Antarctica will continue to be managed by the State. As this is written, the active stations are McMurdo Station, Palmer Station, Lenie, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole. Several others are in a "closed" status, and some are listed as "abandoned."</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	After the <a href="tr-stages.html">Closing Stage</a> of the transition, the State will accept petitions from territories within America whose people wish to separate from America, and petitions from territories outside America whose people wish to become part of America. We will ask that people refrain from requesting these changes until after the new system has had a chance to settle in for a few years.
</p>
<p>
	There is one territory (currently external) we are interested in having as part of America, and many who live there have expressed the desire or willingness to shift into America formally. Their existing laws already allow for this. We will refrain from mentioning the name at this time. It is a region that would more than compensate for the loss of Texas, as far as natural resources and general economic value are concerned. In addition, the regional culture is more compatible with American values than is Confederate culture.
</p>

<h2>Indigenous Areas</h2>

<p>
	It is impractical to reinstate indigenous groups to the lands they occupied at the time of European incursion into the Americas. They are stuck with the lands they currently occupy, although in most cases they were relocated there against their will by the US government. Under the State system, each distinct indigenous group will have the option to declare their lands part of America with the same standing as any other American lands; to separate from America and become independent; to maintain a relationship with the State similar to their relationship with the US; or to negotiate a new relationship.  
</p>
<p>
	The Tohono O'Odham Nation is a special case because their territory straddles the US-Mexico border. Technically, according to US and Mexican law, they inhabit parts of the US state of Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora. Negotiations pertaining to this group must include not only the new American State, but also the Mexican federal government and the Sonoran state government. Should they choose to become an independent country, they will need a corridor to the Pacific Ocean to facilitate trade. That will necessitate cooperation from Mexico and America.
</p>

<h2>The Confederacy</h2>

<p>
	An unfortunate trend in the US over the past two decades or more is a large-scale movement away from democratic principles and inclusion, and toward authoritarianism and racism. Several US states - all of which were members of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War - have gradually passed legislation stripping people of legal rights and human rights, and moving closer to establishing a theocratic dictatorship as the form of government. 
</p>
<p>
	News media highlight selected government officials when reporting on this trend, but we must remember that each of those officials represents the voices of millions of voters. A significant portion of the US population today wants to eliminate democracy altogether, and to impose their preferences on everyone else by force. 
</p>
<p>
	Many US citizens proudly display insignia of sedition, such as the Confederate battle flag, and proudly proclaim that these insignia represent their "heritage." It is the heritage of institutionalized chattel slavery, misogyny, ignorance, superstition, xenophobia, violence, anti-science, censorship, and treason. They openly align with white supremacists, white nationalists, anarchists, Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, Christian extremists who are attempting to implement the Seven Mountains plan, and other dangerous fringe groups dedicated to anti-American values. It is clear they do not wish to be part of a democratic country.
</p>
<p>
	So be it.
</p>
<p>
	We propose to divide the territory of America into two parts - America, an inclusive and democratic nation; and the Confederacy, where those opposed to principles of inclusion and democracy can create a homeland where they feel they belong. We use the name Confederacy as a convenience; we do not know what name the residents of that new country will choose for themselves. The Confederacy will not be part of America; it will be a separate and independent country.
</p>
<p>
	The territory we propose to grant to the Confederacy does not include all the states that belonged to the original Confederate States of America. We will not cede that much land. Any attempt to take more than is offered will elicit an unpleasant response from America. 
</p>
<p>
	We will cede a large contiguous area that includes a wealth of natural resources, ample agricultural land, existing cities and infrastructure, existing manufacturing facilities, existing universities, access to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, several international airports and seaports, thousands of offshore drilling rigs, spacecraft launch facilities and control centers, and the corporate headquarters of several major companies. The headquarters of the so-called "mega-churches," which are important cultural assets for Confederates, are located within the ceded territory, as well.
</p>
<p>
	If the proposal sounds overly generous, remember that the goal is not to punish the Confederates for their disloyalty and embrace of horrific values, but simply to separate them from Americans so the two groups need not experience constant friction. For that to happen, the Confederacy must be viable. Also bear in mind the number of US citizens who support Confederate values is in the neighborhood of 75 million. The Confederacy must have enough living space for them, or they will be unable to settle down and live peacefully.
</p>
<p>
	Americans and Confederates have profoundly different fundamental values that cannot be reconciled. We therefore conclude we will be happier as neighbors than as roomates. The separation is meant to be amicable, as neither country will remain viable for long if the other is weak or incompetent - or openly hostile. 
</p>
<p>
	A core principle of the State's international policy is to stay out of the internal affairs of other countries, and to prevent their intrusion into our own affairs. As long as the Confederates are part of America, we cannot leave each other alone. Each will feel compelled to influence, convert, suppress, or - failing any of those outcomes - exterminate the other. The expenditure of time, effort, and money toward dominating the "other side" will weaken the country and leave everyone vulnerable to external threats. Living in separate countries, each "side" can establish their own laws according to their own values, and we can engage in commercial relations and mutual defense treaties without reference to one another's internal affairs. 
</p>
<p>
	Initially, the territory of the Confederacy is to include South Carolina, southern Georgia (Atlanta and environs along with areas to the north and west of the city remaining with America), Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. 
</p>
<p>
	Some regions within this territory may subsequently petition to join America, based on whatever decision-making mechanism prevails there at the time. It is likely we would welcome most of them without much debate, except the most extremist among them - South Carolina, Florida, and Texas. 
</p>
<p>
	In fact, we include territory between South Carolina and Texas mainly to ensure the Confederacy will have a fair chance to succeed as a nation-state. They will need a large, contiguous territory to succeed. Although all the intervening states have passed extremist legislation in recent years, we believe recovery is possible if that is the will of the majority in those states. The histories of South Carolina and Texas, while different from each other, both suggest cultural recovery is not possible in those states.
