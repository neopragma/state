<h2>1. Principles</h2>

<p>
These are the principles on which our foreign policy is based, and core policies that support them.
</p>

<a name="pillars"/>
<h3>1.1. Principle: No Compromise On the Three Pillars of Independence</h3>

<p>
The <a href="bg-three-pillars.html">Three Pillars of Independence</a> are the foundation and framework for Americans' freedom. Without them, we have nothing. Therefore, the State will sign no international agreement and will tolerate no action by a foreign actor that would undermine the Three Pillars of Independence. 
</p>

<a name="pillars-1"/>
<h4>1.1.1. Policy: No Tolerance for Existential Threats</h4>

<p>
Alliances shift; this is natural. Sometimes they shift gradually or slightly; sometimes they shift rapidly and substantially. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Circa</em> the 2020s alignments of nation-states are quite fluid. Old alliances are showing signs of decay (NATO, European Union), established alliances seem ineffective (OAS, ASEAN, Mercosur). New alliances come and go, and sometimes grow strong roots (BRICS). Historically, this sort of fluidity has been a harbinger of war, especially when accompanied by meaningful changes in the global balance of power. 
</p>
<p> 
The American State will experience conflict or friction with other nations. Few such conflicts rise to the level of an existential threat to America. Most will be resolved through diplomacy, treaties, or trade agreements. Our general policy is to exercise restraint with respect to military solutions, while still maintaining overwhelmingly superior military forces. We want to maintain a robust national economy on a sustainable basis, so that the benefits of doing business with us outweigh the temptation to attack or invade us.
</p>
<p>
When we find ourselves facing a genuine, credible existential threat, our policy is to eliminate it once and for all, permanently. We do not consider this sort of threat to belong to the same category as normal conflicts. 
</p>

<a name="pillars-2"/>
<h4>1.1.2. Policy:  No Hard Dependencies on External Sources for Basic Needs</h4>

<p>
This is the premise of the Three Pillars of Independence, and it has been described elsewhere in these documents. The purpose of this section is to clarify how the Three Pillars affect our foreign policy. 
</p>
<p>
It is possible readers will misunderstand this policy to mean the American State desires no trade with other parties. That is not the case. As documented elsewhere, our formula for peace is <em>stability plus trade</em>. 
</p>
<p>
To ensure our people can live according to their own values and preferences without having to bend to the will of external parties whose fundamental values differ from our own, we must maintain full independence in each of three key areas of basic needs: Food, energy, and defense. 
</p>
<p>
Even in those categories, substantial international trade is possible and desirable. They key is that we must be able to take care of our own needs at a basic level without external dependencies, indefinitely. Of course, like anyone else, we prefer to live better than merely "at a basic level," so we will welcome trade with others for any and all goods and services that are not essential to our independence.
</p>

<a name="jurisdiction"/>
<h3>1.2. Principle: Our State Is for Our People</h3>

<p>
America is not the policeman of the world, the judge and jury for other countries, or the defender of human rights for anyone other than Americans. Similarly, we do not accept anyone's judgment, condemnation, or insistence that we submit to their dominance.
</p>

<a name="juris-1">
<h4>1.2.1. Policy: No Interference In the Internal Affairs of Other Nations</h4>

<p>
We observe that the United States has suffered damage as a result of its engagement with foreign governments and insurgent movements, even when that engagement has been well-intentioned and morally justified.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, the beneficiaries of well-intentioned engagement have turned against the US. A case in point is the Bretton Woods system, established after World War II to help other countries rebuild their economies and to enable international cooperation by using the US Navy to protect global trade routes. The system assured access to markets and to resources so that nations did not need to compete with each other on that level. They have enjoyed substantial benefits economically and socially. 
</p>
<p>
Today, many countries that have benefitted from Bretton Woods say the system represents US hegemony. The reality is those countries would have fallen back into war with one another years ago had it not been for that system.
</p>
<p>
Another example is the US' unconditional support for Israel. This seems to be based on guilt about the Holocaust as well as the Fundamentalist Christian belief that the Jews are God's chosen people. In fact, Israel is a nation-state like any other and has the responsibility to behave as a member of the community of nations. The American State's relations with Israel will be based on the same factors as our relations with other nation-states. When they overreach, such as with their excessive response to the October 7, 2024 Hamas attacks, their misbehavior will not taint us.
</p>
<p>
The American State will use its economic strength generously to assist other nations, but will not establish international organizations, ironclad political alliances with no connection to our own interests, or systems of commerce that will turn against us when the beneficiaries become complacent and convinced they are entitled to our unconditional and eternal support. No one gives us that kind of support, and no one deserves it from us.
</p>
<p>
A final observation about positive US engagement is that wherever the US helped to establish a democratic political system, that system quickly fell apart or was used by despots to climb to power. In some cases, the cost to the US has been extreme; after 20 years in Afghanistan, thousands of American lives, hundreds of thousands of Afghan lives, and every effort to establish democratic institutions, the Taliban took power not five minutes after the US withdrawal. The object lesson for the American State is that this sort of engagement is not worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the US has also suffered damage due to engagement that was <em>not</em> well justified, often in support of corporate interests rather than national ones. These have included the overthrow of legally-elected governments, the support of violent insurgent groups, the support of bloodthirsty dictators, and outright military conquest accompanied by systematic massacres of civilians and/or mass relocations of people. That approach to foreign policy has created many enemies for the US. 
</p>
<p>
The American State does not desire that sort of international reputation. We do not believe it is necessary to take such a heavy-handed approach to international relations.
</p>
<p>
Beyond these practical concerns, there is the question of the "moral high ground." The US frequently criticizes others for violations of human rights, ethnic cleansing, territorial expansion, and other issues. But the US, itself, was built on a foundation of genocide, mass relocation, slavery, military conquest, and exploitation of the poor. By eschewing such actions, the American State will earn the right to speak out against abuses elsewhere and to cite such abuses as reasons to discontinue trade with bad actors, even if we do not directly interfere with them.	
</p>
<p>	
The State will not demand that any foreign government adjust its internal policies as a condition of entering into agreements with America. Our values and principles apply to our own people. We can do business with anyone, provided they stay out of our internal affairs. It is only fair we stay out of theirs, as well.
</p>
<p>
That said, if a state such as Nazi Germany should arise and carry out actions that are too difficult for us to stomach, the Three Pillars of Independence will ensure we can do quite well without them. Our hope is that the value of trade and other relations with us will influence bad actors to mitigate their behavior. But that is only a hope, not a plan. Historically, bad actors have demonstrated they are unmoved by humanitarian considerations, reason, or financial incentives. So be it. We withdraw from that game.
</p>


<a name="juris-2">
<h4>1.2.2. Policy: No Tolerance for External Interference In Our Internal Affairs</h4>
<p>
Just as the State will not interfere with others, we will not tolerate any interference in our own internal affairs. 
</p>
<p>
This is not to say we will never listen to anyone. Some foreign cultures seem to be relatively civilized. Their observations, criticisms, and suggestions are well worth considering. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the majority of foreign cultures seem to be relatively barbaric, and quite a few can be characterized as downright savage. These are by far the most vocal critics of the US, and are likely to be vocal critics of the American State and anyone else they choose. Their opinions have less intrinsic value than those of civilized people.
</p>


<a name="approach"/>
<h2>2. Approach</h2>

<p>
This section outlines the State's approach to international relations.
</p>

<a name="challenges"/>
<h3>2.1. Practical Challenges</h3>

<p>
As we elaborate these ideas for America, the world is undergoing two significant changes: climate change and multipolarization. 
</p>

<h4>2.1.1. Climate Change</h4>

<p>
The more critical and impactful of these is climate change. The effects of climate change are already being felt, and the environmental changes are accelerating. We are facing many years of unpredictability before the global ecosystem settles into a new equilibrium, and we cannot guess what that new equilibrium will be like. 
</p>
<p>
Our general strategy to deal with the unpredictable effects of climate change is to build as much resiliency into the system as we can, with the goal of maximizing our ability to adapt to change. Past US policies seem to be based on the assumption that the "old order" will last indefinitely. That is the opposite of resiliency.
</p>

<h4>2.1.2. Shifting Alliances</h4>

<p>
With economic, political, and military power now shifting, old alliances are faltering and new ones are forming. Most new alliances fail quickly, but some are becoming stable. Countries one would not have expected to cooperate are experimenting with cooperation. Countries once friendly are turning against each other in the name of self-interest. 
</p>
<p>
The Bretton Woods system, established in the 1940s to re-stabilize the world in the aftermath of World War II, is coming apart as a result of natural historical change. Protection of international shipping lanes by the US Navy was the enabler for a global just-in-time supply chain. This is no longer feasible. Individual countries and temporary alliances must handle their own trade and defense.
</p>
<p>
Not only is the US losing international influence, it is not even a stable, unified country anymore. Political and social change within the United States raise questions about American identity and national goals. Is there an American identity, or are there several or many, and are they compatible? Are there national goals the people agree on, or are there different visions for the country's future? 
</p>
<p>
Lacking a shared identity and shared values, there is no basis for crafting meaningful foreign policy that both our own people and our international partners can depend on. Whichever political group gains temporary power will discard policies enacted by other groups and set their own. And this will happen repeatedly. No one can count on the United States.
</p>
<p>
The State's focus on American interests may smack of the old America First mindset. America First was always used as a catch-phrase to cover ultra-nationalism, racism, xenophobia, and hubris. The State is interested in the liberty and prosperity of all Americans, without reference to the outdated notions of the past. 
</p>
<p>
In the context of international relations, it means no foreign country is "special," and no foreign country is an "enemy" by nature. We will support those who request it, but not "at any cost" to ourselves. We will defend our independence to the fullest extent necessary, but without hatred, and we will stop once the threat has been eliminated.
</p>


<a name="mindset"/>
<h3>2.2. Mindset</h3>

<p>
United States foreign policy has been heavy-handed since the earliest days of the republic. Driven by emotionally-charged concepts like American Exceptionalism and Manifest Destiny, and tainted by deep cultural and institutional racism, the country has acted like a schoolyard bully. Strategies to support US interests have mainly been in the nature of containment, colonization, military occupation, economic sanctions, and promises of mass death such as the Mutually-Assured Destruction doctrine of the Cold War. The power elite have always used the US military as their private tool to force others to obey, and to take whatever natural resources another country might have.
</p>
<p>
To the extent a collective may be said to have a "mindset," the State has the mindset of survival. The Three Pillars of Independence are concerned with maintaining conditions under which Americans are free to live as they choose to live without external interference. Those pillars are the foundation of the State's approach to foreign policy. 
</p>
<p>
The two key challenges of the present era - climate change and multipolarization - lead us to focus on resilience rather than preemption, containment, or retribution to deal with hostile foreign powers. We cannot predict the ultimate effects of climate change on our ability to provide for our own needs, and we cannot depend on the ever-shifting alliances of a multipolar world to settle down into a stable regime such as the one that prevailed from the 1940s to the 2010s. 
</p>
<p>
In our view, this means the new America must cultivate positive relationships with anyone and everyone regardless of the others' political system, religion/philosophy, human rights record, or past history of grievance or friction with the US. 
</p>

<a name="relationships"/>
<h3>2.3. Relationships</h3>

<p>
The State's approach will be to build positive working relationships with as many governments as possible, regardless of whether America "needs" the help or support of those governments in the moment. We are always engaged in a constructive way. The intent is that when unexpected problems arise, many governments will be ready to offer support naturally, because of the ongoing positive relationship with the State. 
</p>
<p>
This means engaging with governments whose policies are distasteful to us. The key point to remember is they are not us. The form of government, human rights records, and propaganda of those governments are irrelevant. Only the Three Pillars of Independence are relevant (to us). The purpose of the State is to support the <em>American</em> people.
</p>
<p>
Many Americans will recoil at the thought of doing business with a foreign country that engages in human rights abuses within their own territory. The advantage of our approach to foreign policy is that when America is fully independent, Americans can freely make the choice not to do business with such countries. As long as there are any dependencies on the country in question, Americans are not free to step away from engagement. 
</p>
<p>
Due to the economic strength of America, it will be in other countries' interests to engage with us. Therefore, in a roundabout way, our hands-off policy may influence other governments to refrain from human rights abuses. The State will not attempt to influence other countries' human rights abuses from a moralistic position. It is not our purpose to impose our own morality on others; our purpose is to support the needs of our <em>own</em> people. 
</p>
<p>
Our influence will be in the nature of <em>soft power</em> - because it will be desirable for others to engage with us, they may choose to adjust their domestic policies such that Americans wish to engage with them. Should they choose not to do so, their decision can do America no harm.
</p>

<a name="stability"/>
<h3>2.4. Seek Stability First, Then Peace</h3>

<p>
We observe national governments that seek peace "at all costs" often give way to bullies and tyrants in the hope they can avoid war. The problem is the phrase, "at all costs." When facing a belligerent and ambitious foreign power, "all costs" may be too much to pay for the illusion of "peace."
</p>
<p>
We further observe governments that focus on the <em>stability</em> of the global order and of bilateral relationships enjoy more peace and prosperity than those that simply avoid conflict at any cost. The formula for peace is: 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	Stability + Trade = Peace
</p>
<p>
The State will focus on stability first, using peaceful or forceful methods as necessary to ensure stability. Stability is the foundation for genuine and lasting peace. There will be times when an aggressor disrupts the system and introduces instability, and they must be dealt with. We prefer peace, but we must remain cognizant of the costs and make choices that yield the maximum benefit and/or minimum harm, in keeping with Utilitarian Ethics. 
</p>
<p>
Peace as such is not the foundation of our foreign policy; it is an <em>outcome</em>, arising naturally from stability and trade. Peace is the outcome we desire, but we cannot control the actions of others. The State is obligated to deal with those actions in whatever way is necessary to support the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>

<a name="neutrality"/>
<h3>2.5. Default Position of Neutrality</h3>

<p>
In any given situation when international tension arises, the State will confer with all governments with which we have positive working relationships and seek collaborative approaches to restore stability. We will not rush to "choose sides" in the conflict. 
</p>
<p>
We observe <em>stability</em> is often better served when powerful states take a neutral position than when they back one side or the other. However, this is not a hard-and-fast rule to be followed mindlessly. Maintaining the Three Pillars of Independence is always our primary goal in international relations. Should we determine that choosing a side will serve our national interests better than maintaining neutrality, then we will choose that side. 
</p>
<p>
We observe and expect that most international conflicts can be resolved without recourse to war if the more-powerful players remain calm and demonstrate steady, consistent leadership. However, there are times when an aggressor <em>insists</em> on war. When that happens, we intend to be in an overwhelmingly dominant position.
</p>

<a name="econpower"/>
<h3>2.6. Use Economic Power Generously</h3>

<p>
	As the preeminent economic power in the world, America can afford to be generous with funding development programs and helping other countries in need as a way to build positive working relationships and encourage a willingness to cooperate in future, when we may need their support.
</p>
<p>
	This also helps to maintain the stability of the global order by building the security and prosperity of as many countries as possible. This approach also enables greater prosperity, as countries that are stable, prosperous, and secure make better business partners, customers, and suppliers than countries that are "held down" as a way to make them dependent.
</p>
<p>
	The State's policy to make use of America's economic strength is driven, in part, by demographic trends. As the boomer generation moves out of the workforce and is replaced by gen-X, which is a much smaller cohort, America will have difficulty supporting social services. There will be more people drawing benefits than there are contributing to the system. Eventually, gen-X will retire and gen-Y will reach its maximum earning capacity. Gen-Y is another large cohort, almost as large as the boomers. But in the interim, when gen-X is the primary engine of wealth-generation, there will be economic challenges.
</p>
<p>
	Most analysts today (mid-2022) agree that all developed countries are facing a gradual decline in population, and will probably face extended periods of economic recession in the coming decades. But they tend to look only at the usual suspects - western Europe, Japan and South Korea, and the anglophone countries. Most analyses never mention Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, or Africa at all. Yet, many countries in those regions have younger populations than the "developed" world.
</p>
<p>
	 The State will pay due attention to these regions, and use America's economic strength to help them develop into stable and prosperous trade partners. During gen-X's ascendancy, we can bolster America's economy through trade with these emerging economies. That approach represents a radical departure from US foreign policy. It marks the end of the Bretton Woods era, bringing new economic partners to the fore. 
</p>

<a name="ring"/>
<h3>2.7. Concentric Ring Concept</h3>

<p>
	Our general approach is to build positive working relationships with foreign governments and to use our economic power generously to help establish stability and support economic development worldwide. However, some countries are more important to America than others.
</p>
<p>
	We think of other countries as falling into concentric circles or rings around America. These are not necessarily based on geography, except for the innermost ring. 
</p>
<p>
	The 2020s are a time of significant shifts in international alliances. Blocs and associations that have existed since the end of World War II are losing cohesiveness as member states find independent directions for their futures. New alliances and blocs are being formed, growing, shrinking, dissolving, or gaining power and influence. It is not possible to compile a list of "friendly" countries and a list of "unfriendly" countries that would be meaningful for more than a week. 
</p>
<p>
	Besides choices made by other countries, America may wish to reconsider whether and how to carry forward international relationships of the United States. The US has supported certain countries and regimes whose behavior may be inconsistent with American values, and/or may have negative implications for the American economy or full independence as we define it. At the same time, the US has maintained hostile relations with certain countries for its own reasons, and the State may not consider them to be threats or natural enemies.
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, the State will seek stable and mutually-beneficial relations with all countries, with a focus on those meeting criteria such as geographical proximity, economic benefits, cultural compatibility, and demonstrated dependability as allies. 
</p>

<a name="ring1"/>	
<h4>2.5.1. Innermost Ring</h4>

<p>
	Of primary importance to the the State's international relations are the countries that have land borders with America, or that are located nearby. These include
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Canada</li>
		<li>Mexico</li>
		<li>Confederacy (see the <a href="bg-territory.html">Backgrounder on American Territory</a>)</li>
		<li>Caribbean island nations</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	As a matter of enlightened self-interest, America needs strong and positive relations with these countries. Their stability, prosperity, and support are crucial to meeting our goal of sustainable individual liberty for Americans. 
</p>
<p>
	In addition, due to the physical proximity of these countries, it is critically important that their territories are never available to hostile states to use as staging areas for attacks on or invasions of America. This would be regarded as an existential threat and would be handled accordingly.
</p>


<a name="ring2"/>
<h4>2.5.2. Second Ring</h4>

<p>
	Of equal or nearly-equal importance are countries we know we can rely on as allies or as reliably-neutral actors, and whose cultural and political values are compatible (not necessarily identical) with our own. Some examples include
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Most countries in the Americas</li>
		<li>Japan</li>
		<li>South Korea</li>
		<li>Australia</li>	
		<li>New Zealand</li>	
		<li>Thailand</li>	
		<li>India</li>	
		<li>Kenya</li>
		<li>Most countries in Europe</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	However, we must remember that nation-states are not individuals; two countries cannot be "friends" in a meaningful sense of the word. Any of these countries will turn against us in a heartbeat if they perceive even a hint of the possibility of benefit to themselves, including short-term benefit at the cost of long-term stability, prosperity, and freedom. They are all in it for themselves, and so must we be.
</p>


<a name="ring3"/>
<h4>2.5.3. Third Ring</h4>

<p>
	All others. There is no way to predict how alliances may form, mutate, and dissolve. Therefore, we must be ready to work with anyone at any time, and we must establish resiliency so we can survive any unexpected twists and turns in international relations.
</p>

<a name="treaties"/>
<h2>3. Treaties and Memberships</h2>

<p>
The State will enter into treaties and join international organizations just as every other government does. The fact the State completely replaces the US government means that America will not automatically inherit treaty agreements and international memberships from the US. We will have to renegotiate treaties (e.g., the Paris Agreement on climate change, the New START nuclear weapons agreement with Russia) and re-apply for membership in international organizations (e.g., Organization of American States (OAS), United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)). It is likely, but not guaranteed, that the State will wish to belong to the same international organizations as the US.
</p>
<p>
Per the <a href="transition.html">Transition Plan</a>, the State will issue public declarations of intent to adhere to all treaties of the US until such time as each agreement can be renegotiated with the State as the signatory for America. The State will comply with the rules of organizations to which the US belonged with respect to changing the membership to the State or applying for new membership. Should an organization prefer not to include America, the State will respect their wishes.
</p>
<p>
In cases when the State does not wish to continue to participate in an alliance to which the United States had been party, we will exit the alliance gracefully in a way that minimizes disruption for the other members. Most organizations have a documented procedure for members to withdraw. In other cases, the State will work with the organization to achieve a graceful exit.
</p>

<a name="territory"/>
<h2>4. The Physical Territory of America</h2>

<p>
	Eventually, the physical territory of America may differ from that of the present-day US. As a starting point, we define American territory as documented in the <a href="bg-territory.html">Backgrounder on American Territory</a>.
</p>
<p>
	US states have a mixed history. Some were founding members of the United States. Some joined by free choice. Others were purchased from colonial countries that had conquered and occupied them. A few were taken by military force. We do not intend to sift through history and attempt to right all past wrongs. The present-day states except as noted above will be taken as the default, initial territory of America. 
</p>
<p>
	With regard to US territories, the State treats them differently based on whether they have permanent civilian populations.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Organized territories and American Samoa - the residents will choose whether to become part of the new America or to become independent countries. The organized territories are those that have permanent, non-military populations. They include Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition to these, American Samoa has a permanent civilian population, but is not "organized" according to the US Constitution. Because it has a permanent civilian population, the State considers it in this group.</li>
		<li>Unorganized territories have no permanent civilian populations. Initially, they will remain under American control as military bases. These include Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Wake Island, and Navassa Island.</li>
		<li>The US science stations in Antarctica will continue to be managed by the State. As this is written, the active stations are McMurdo Station, Palmer Station, Lenie, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole. Several others are in a "closed" status, and some are listed as "abandoned."</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	After the <a href="tr-stages.html">Closing Stage</a> of the transition, the State will accept petitions from territories within America whose people wish to separate from America, and petitions from territories outside America whose people wish to become part of America. We will ask that people refrain from requesting these changes until after the new system has had a chance to settle in for a few years.
</p>
<p>
	There is one territory we are interested in having as part of America, and many who live there have expressed the desire or willingness to shift into America formally. Their existing laws already allow for this. We will refrain from mentioning the name at this time. It is a region that would more than compensate for the loss of Texas, as far as natural resources and general economic value are concerned. In addition, the regional culture is more compatible with American values than is Texan culture.
</p>


<a name="shortterm"/>
<h2>5. Short-Term Priorities</h2>

<p>
The 2020s are a time of volatility. Nation-states and alliances are too unstable to enable us to craft detailed policies for engagement with any given country or region beyond our own neighborhood. Yet, there are a few major issues that will require the immediate attention of the State. One may regard these as leftover problems from the US. While the State does not accept blame or responsibility for past policies of the US, it is sensible to address major problems in the interest of stability and peace.
</p>
<p>
	We consider the most urgent issues in the international sphere to be the following:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Establishing the Confederacy</li>
		<li>Stabilizing the immediate neighborhood</li>
		<li>Concluding the Korean Conflict</li>
		<li>Implementing post-Bretton Woods defense and economic strategy</li>
	</ul>
