<h1>The Three Pillars of Independence</h1>

<p>
What conditions must be true for the people to live according to their own values without external interference? 
</p>

<h2>Effect of Foreign Dependencies on Our Freedom</h2>

<p>
When one country holds sway over another, through economic hegemony, military threat, or control of a key need such as food, energy, or defense, it is not possible for the government, companies, or individuals in the second country to make decisions freely according to their own values and goals. They must comply with anything the first country demands of them, even when doing so causes them to suffer physically or emotionally, and to act contrary to their own deeply-held values. In some cases, the second country may be forced to act in a way contrary to its own long-term interests, in order to avoid short-term pain. 
</p>
<p>
To be truly free, we must establish the conditions in our own country that enable us to speak and act in accordance with our own values, without bending to the will of any foreign power. 
</p>
<p>
This is the reason for our harshness regarding the Three Pillars of Independence. The pillars are the sturdy framework that enables the State to uphold individual liberty on a sustainable basis. Such liberty cannot extend to the point that it tears down this framework; otherwise, liberty itself will be subverted. No one's personal freedom in the short term trumps everyone else's freedom in the long term.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, a company that takes the position of "company over country" may be prosecuted, and an individual who seeks personal wealth at the expense of everyone else's freedom may be prosecuted. These prosecutions will be harsher than those for ordinary crimes, because they are not ordinary crimes; they are an existential threat to the country.  
</p>

<h2>No external dependencies for food</h2>

<p>
If people depend on external sources of food, or food cannot be distributed to those who need it, then those who control the food sources can dictate that the people conform to their values, deliver whatever they demand, and support their actions, whatever they may be. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the people can only be free if they can produce and distribute their own food. This pertains to basic foods, not luxury goods. It means "the people" as a whole, not every individual separately.
</p>
<p>
The first pillar is Independence in Food Production and Distribution.
</p>

<h2>No external dependencies for energy</h2>

<p>
If people depend on external sources of energy, or energy cannot be distributed to those who need it, then those who control the energy sources can dictate that the people conform to their values, deliver whatever they demand, and support their actions, whatever they may be.  
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the people can only be free if they can generate and distribute their own energy. It means "the people" as a whole, not every individual separately. 
</p>
<p>
The second pillar is Independence in Energy Production and Distribution.
</p>

<h2>No external dependencies for defense</h2>
<p>
If people depend on external support for national defense, then those who provide such support can dictate that the people conform to their values, deliver whatever they demand, and support their actions, whatever they may be.  
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the people can only be free if they can defend the country without dependency on foreign sources of equipment, raw materials, or direct support. It means "the people" as a whole, not every individual separately. This means core homeland defenses, and not necessarily every weapon system deployed in every theater.
</p>
<p>
The third pillar is Independence in Defense.
