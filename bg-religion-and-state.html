<h1>Backgrounder on Religion and the State</h1>

<p>
This Backgrounder concerns the relationship between the State and organized religion. 
</p>

<h2>1. Historical Context</h2>

<p>
Some governments have been based explicitly on a religion, and others have formally separated religion from government. Having an official religion does not automatically cause problems for people's freedom (Spain, Italy), but it opens the door for oppression and human rights violations (Iran, Saudi Arabia). In countries that have diverse populations - including followers of different religions - the friction between the official religion and minority religions often leads to bloodshed (India, Iraq). Often, variants of the same religion come into conflict - Catholics <em>vs.</em> Protestants (many countries), Sunni <em>vs.</em> Shia (many countries), etc. 
</p>

<h3>1.1. US Constitution</h3>

<p>
The First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits the federal government from establishing an official religion for the country. (This did not stop individual US states from including religion in their constitutions.) This part of the Amendment is often called the "separation clause," and the phrase "separation of church and state" is common in the US. 
</p>
<p>
The reason for the "separation clause" was that many English and other European migrants to the New World were escaping religious persecution. The governments of their countries of origin imposed an official religion, and persecuted those who followed different religions. The Founders wanted the citizens of the new country to be free of that persecution. 
</p>
<p>
Apart from that desire, the founders were well aware how fragile the nascent union was, and how beset with enemies on all sides. They didn't want to alienate colonists who feared religious persecution.
</p>
<p>
However, the range of different religious faiths that were considered at that time was limited to variations of Christianity. All forms of Christianity share nearly all fundamental values and beliefs. The differences are more a matter of form than of substance - the formalities of worship services; the particular words used in prayers and rituals; whether one makes the sign of the cross and, if so, how one holds the hand when doing so; the design of the robes worn by clergy; whether priests were allowed to marry and have families; and so forth. 
The Founders may not have imagined that over time, people would come to the country from many more places than just Europe, and that they would bring with them values and beliefs very different from, and possibly hostile to traditional and historical European values and beliefs. 
</p>
<p>
For example, there are belief systems in which it is considered proper to decapitate one's own daughter, should she happen to glance at a boy with interest. There is no room for this in America.
</p>

<h3>1.2. Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h3>

<p>
Article 18 of the UDHR defines freedom of religion as a human right. The UDHR was written immediately after World War II. One of the defining characteristics of that war was religious persecution. The main perpetrators of the war in Europe, the Nazis, attempted to exterminate the entire Jewish and Romani populations of Europe based partly on racist beliefs and partly on differences in religion. That was the context for Article 18 of the UDHR.
</p>
<p>
As this is written, one of the justifications the Russians offer for their aggression in Europe is the superiority of Orthodox Christianity over other belief systems. Similarly, extreme religious groups such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and Boko Haram in Nigeria justify their human rights abuses on the basis of religion, claiming their variant of Islam is "pure."
</p>
<p>

<h2>2. General Position of the State</h2>

</p>
<p>
We agree with the UDHR that freedom of religion is a human right, and we agree with the general spirit of the "separation clause" in the First Amendment to the US Constitution. We hold a stronger position on the separation of religion and government than the US Constitution.
</p>
<p>
We observe the following:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Religion plays a large role in every human culture, past and present. Therefore, we see it as an important and fundamental part of human life.</li>
		<li>Faith can play a positive role in an individual's life, but when extended across a large population, organized religion tends to do more harm than good. The majority of wars and systematic oppression or genocide throughout history have been motivated (or at least justified) by religion.</li>
		<li>True believers in a religion must, almost by definition, think of theirs as the "one true faith," and have great difficulty granting equal treatment to outsiders without risking a lapse of faith themselves. In a society that includes followers of multiple different faiths, there is danger in mixing any one religion with the overall government. It would be all but impossible for minority believers to receive fair treatment from such a government. Perhaps ironically (or perhaps <em>obviously</em>), only an atheist is truly capable of treating all religious believers justly and fairly, without prejudice. Any true believer will elevate followers of their own faith above others; otherwise, are they <em>true</em> believers?</li>
		<li>There is no physical evidence of the existence of a god or gods. Furthermore, the concept of "god" is variable, and there is no single, consistent definition. Osiris is not the same concept as Ishtar, who is not the same concept as Allah, who is not the same concept as Vishnu, who is not the same concept as Buddha, who is not the same concept as Odin, who is not the same concept as Huitzilopochtli, who is not the same concept as Ahura Mazda, and so on. The State cannot include such a vague concept in its philosophical foundations, as it does not help to support the goal of the State to maximize individual liberty.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the State's general position is:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>All religions are legal in the State. Followers may conduct whatever rituals and other activities are defined in their religion, except those that violate human rights, legal rights, or statutory law, or that undermine the Three Pillars of Independence. In other words, the individual liberty of religious believers is subject to the same limitations as everyone else's; neither more nor less.</li>
		<li>The State has no opinion and will make no laws based on, supportive of, or in opposition to any particular organized religion or religious philosophy. When a philosophical point underlying some aspect of the State aligns with that of any specific religion, the alignment is coincidental, and the State arrived at that conclusion by non-religious reasoning.</li>
		<li>Religious beliefs will not be accepted as a defense in criminal trials.</li>
		<li>Religious rules about confidentiality or secrecy carry no weight in criminal investigations or trials.</li>
		<li>When one religious group or its members (including atheists) subverts the human rights or legal rights of another religious group or its members (including atheists), the State will treat the matter as a violation of human rights or legal rights; the religious (or anti-religious) justification will not be considered. Just as in any offense, the <em>harm done</em> is the primary factor determining guilt and punishment.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>3. Examples of Separation of Religion and the State</h2>

<p>
Notwithstanding the First Amendment, concepts unique to Protestantism are deeply ingrained in the present-day system of laws in the US. The typical American reader of this document may not immediately see the implications of the strict separation of religion and the State in the new system. The following points are meant to clarify the matter.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Marriage.</strong> The concept of <em>marriage</em> varies among religious faiths. Most define marriage as between one man and one woman, but other configurations are also defined in some faiths. Under the State system, consenting individuals of majority age may register as a <em>household</em> for purposes of hospital visitation rights, probate law, income tax category, and other matters in which the household, rather than the individual, is the logical unit of citizenship for purposes of assuring maximum liberty, human rights, and legal rights. Individuals can withdraw from a household or dissolve the household entirely at any time for any reason without interference from the State, by following a simple administrative procedure. Such withdrawal or dissolution may be more complicated when children are involved, and the adult members of the household are not in agreement of who should take each child. Another complication is the disposition of jointly-held property in the event of withdrawal or dissolution. These complications are no worse than complications in the present-day system, and are solvable.

			<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> Members of a faith community may enter into "marriage" as defined in that community, with no interference from the State, provided the rituals do not otherwise violate statutory law. However, such status has no legal standing for purposes of State law, government procedures, criminal investigations, trials, and so forth.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> In the current system, married individuals are not required to testify against one another in court. The State does not define, recognize, or manage "marriage" in any way. Therefore, there is no such protection under the State system. Any witness called is expected to testify. The legal construct of "household" does not protect household members from the testimony of other household members.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 3:</em> The concept of a "marriage license" has no meaning when religion and State are fully separated. Under the State system, there will be no marriage licenses.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 4:</em> Some religious traditions allow girls who have not reached the age of majority to be "married" to older men. There is no basis for this practice under the State system, and it will be treated the same as any other example of child abuse.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 5:</em> The State will define a maximum number of household members as a hedge against people using the ease of household registration as a "back door" for immigration. It is not done because of any religious or quasi-religious notion of how many consenting adults "should" belong to a household.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 6:</em> While we expect most households will care for any children belonging to its members as a matter of human decency, and probably due to mutual affection, as well, for legal purposes the State holds the natural or adoptive parents of each child responsible for the well-being of that child.
		</li>
		<li class="linespace"><strong>Taxation.</strong> Religious organizations are not exempt from taxes. The State is prohibited from treating a religious organization any differently than other types of organizations. 
			<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> A religious organization may register a separate non-profit corporation to carry out "good works" that are beneficial to the society, such as thrift stores, soup kitchens, youth activities, or conseling services. These non-profit corporations will be eligible for tax relief - not because they are religious, but because they are charitable organizations that benefit the society. They are free to provide advice to their clientele based on their religious faith, due to freedom of expression, but not to conduct "official" religious services. The purpose of this is to discourage the formation of a "religion" whose only purpose is to squeeze money from the gullible, such as televangelism. We recognize this is a large loophole, but we choose to err on the side of maximizing individual liberty over minimizing tax avoidance strategies by religions.
		</li>
		<li class="linespace"><strong>Freedom of Expression.</strong> Religious believers may display symbols and decorations and wear clothing and accessories relevant to their faith at any time and in any place. 
			<br/><br/><em>Note 1:</em> Our philosophy of separation does not imply that individual Americans are restricted from expressing their faith. That would be contrary to the purpose of the State - to ensure maximum individual liberty. Therefore, there are no restrictions on displaying religious symbols at work places, including tax-supported institutions. We do not accept the argument that one's personal freedom is infringed simply because one can see religious decorations associated with a different faith than one's own (including atheism). 
			<br/><br/>
			Individuals working at a government facility in a Kansas town that is 100% Christian will not be prevented from displaying a Nativity scene during the Christmas season because of fears it will offend a Hindu or Jew or atheist who lives in California. In this respect the present-day US has taken the idea of church-state separation to an unhealthy extreme. Freedom of religion is defined as a human right in our Constitution. Individuals do not lose their human rights just because they accept a job at a tax-supported institution.
			<br/><br/><em>Note 2:</em> There may be circumstances in which is is necessary for officers of the State to see a person's face; for instance, as part of a security screening procedure. When this is necessary, it will be done with appropriate respect for the individual's privacy. The face cannot be covered in passport photos, regardless of religious belief.
		</li>	
		<li class="linespace"><strong>Buildings and Monuments.</strong> As there is no connection between religion and the State, there is no basis for the State to fund the maintenance or restoration of buildings and monuments owned by religions, as is common in Europe. However, if such a building or monument is deemed to be of historical importance to the society as a whole, the State may choose to allocate funds for its maintenance and upkeep. This will never be done because the structure is associated with a religion. It will only be done when the structure has general historical or cultural significance to the society at large.
