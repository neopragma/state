<h1>Backgrounder on Standard Currency</h1>

<p>
One problem with the present-day US is that more than one currency is in use for economic exchange. Only the official government currency is protected by federal law. The several cryptocurrencies in general use are unstable and offer no insurance or protecton for consumers.
</p>
<p>
In keeping with its duty to maintain conditions under which Americans can live in freedom, the State will define the official government currency as the only legal medium of exchange for commercial transactions. It will be backed by the government and the people will be protected from loss due to fraud or trickery. 
</p>
<p>
People may still barter informally on a small scale, as they currently do. This principle is not meant to stop that kind of grassroots activity. We consider it to be part of Americans' individual liberty. The principle is meant to protect the public from unreliable schemes.
