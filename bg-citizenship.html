<h1>Backgrounder on Citizenship</h1>

<p>
Brittanica defines <em>citizenship</em> as the "relationship between an individual and a state to which the individual owes allegiance and in turn is entitled to its protection. Citizenship implies the status of freedom with accompanying responsibilities. Citizens have certain rights, duties, and responsibilities that are denied or only partially extended to aliens and other noncitizens residing in a country." We appreciate this definition.
</p>
<p>
In this document, the word Citizen written with a capital C refers to State Citizens (Basic or Full).

<h2>1. Two Kinds of Americans</h2>

<p>
Pursuant to the State's duty to accommodate all Americans to the extent practical, we mut consider the philosophical differences between two broad groups of Americans. 
</p>
<p>
One group feels as if it is important to belong to something larger than themselves, such as a community, a society, or a nation-state - or all three. They understand their own individual liberty is contingent on their defending and supporting everyone else's.
</p>
<p>
The other group feels as if they are entirely independent. They owe nothing to anyone else. These are the people who say "taxation is theft" and who are not happy to contribute in any way to anyone else's welfare besides their own. 
</p>
<p>
In order to create conditions in which both these groups are able to live according to their own values, we define two levels of citizenship. Basic Citizenship applies to all citizens of the State. It is treated as a <em>human right</em> and cannot be taken from a person for any reason. Full Citizenship applies to citizens who demonstrate full engagement with the system, as a person who is fully engaged and invested in a system will make choices that benefit the whole, according to studies.
</p>
<p>
	People can change between Full and Basic Citizenship multiple times throughout their lives. These changes are always a matter of free choice and are entirely in the hands of the individual. This includes the case when an individual is convicted of a crime and loses Full Citizenship for the duration of their sentence - they <em>chose</em> to commit the crime. Therefore, this arrangement is consistent with the principle of individual liberty.
</p>


<a name="fullcitizenship"/>
<h2>2. Full Citizenship</h2>

<p>
Full Citizenship is earned and maintained by:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Opting into all income taxes and the associated social services; and</li>
		<li>Avoiding conviction for criminal offenses; and</li>
		<li>Fulfilling the duties of Full Citizenship; and</li>
		<li>Renouncing any foreign citizenship(s).</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The duties of Full Citizenship are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Casting a vote on all occasions when a matter is brought before the people for a vote; and</li>
		<li>Serving on juries when called.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The privileges of Full Citizenship are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eligibility to serve in the government; and</li>
		<li>Eligibility to hold commissioned officer rank in the military; and</li>
		<li>Eligibility to work in the field of law enforcement; and</li>
		<li>Elevated voting and petition strength.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Full Citizens <em>must</em> vote and <em>must</em> serve on juries when called. They <em>may</em> join the government in both elected and appointed roles. 
</p>
<p>
Basic Citizens <em>may</em> vote and <em>may</em> serve on juries when called. They <em>cannot</em> join the government in any role.
</p>
<p>
In the table below, entries annotated with (Duty) are mandatory for the given level of citizenship, and entries annotated with (Legal Right) are options for the given level of citizenship.

<h2>3. Basic Citizenship</h2>

<p>
By default, all citizens by birth, naturalization, or transfer are Full Citizens. They become Basic Citizens by choice in one of the following ways:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Opting out of one or more of the optional income tax categories and the social service it funds; or</li>
		<li>Choosing not to fulfill one of the duties of Full Citizenship; or</li>
		<li>Obtaining citizenship in a foreign country; or</li>
		<li>Being convicted of a crime.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
All Citizens below the age of majority are Full Citizens regardless of any offenses they may commit. Only a person of majority age may choose to relinquish Full Citizenship status.
</p>
<p>
On an annual basis, all Citizens may opt in or out of any or all of the optional income tax categories.
</p>
<p>
If convicted of a Category 1 or 2 crime, a citizen is reduced to Basic Citizenship status for the duration of their sentence plus one calendar year following their date of release. If the court does not impose a sentence, the convicted Citizen is reduced to Basic Citizenship for one year following the date of conviction.
</p>
<p>
In the case of civilian government service, the individual is removed from their position. In the case of law enforcement personnel, the individual need not be removed from their job but cannot carry weapons on duty. In the case of a commissioned military officer, the individual need not lose rank, but must be limited to "desk duty" and cannot function in a command role.
</p>
<p>
If it is later determined that a citizen was wrongly convicted of a crime, and they were Full Citizens at the time of conviction, the benefits they should have accrued during their incarceration and/or subsequent waiting period will be restored to them.
</p>
<p>
An individual who holds multiple citizenship will be a Basic Citizen in America even if they opt in to all income tax categories and social services. The State does not prohibit dual/multiple citizenship, but considers a person who holds multiple citizenship may not be fully invested in the system or unambiguously loyal to the country. In the case of a commissioned military officer, the individual will be reduced to the highest non-commissioned rank.
</p>
<p>
The duties of Basic Citizenship are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pay the basic income tax (the only mandatory income tax category)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The privileges of Basic Citizenship are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eligibility to cast a vote on all matters that are brought before the people for a vote;</li>
		<li>Eligibility to serve on a jury when called.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Implicit in this is the fact that a Full Citizen who is serving in the government, in law enforcement, or as a commissioned military officer will lose their position if they fail to uphold the duties of Full Citizenship.
</p>

<a name="provisionalcitizenship"/>
<h2>4. Provisional Citizenship</h2>

<p>
This is a temporary status that only applies to children from abroad who are in the process of being adopted by American citizens. It is intended to prevent their being "in limbo" with no official status. They are eligible for the same social services as the children of Citizens, and they are authorized to attend State schools or any other accredited schools.
</p>
<p>
Provisional Citizenship is temporary; it is not guaranteed for life in the same way as Basic Citizenship. If the adoption process is completed, the child becomes a Full Citizen. If the adoption process is abandoned, the child loses status and must leave the country.
</p>

<a name="acquiringcitizenship"/>
<h2>5. Acquiring Citizenship</h2>

<p>
There are three methods to acquire Citizenship in the State: By birth, by naturalization, and by transfer.
</p>

<a name="citbybirth"/>
<h3>5.1. Citizenship By Birth</h3>
<p>
All individuals born to a parent who is a Citizen at the time of birth are Full Citizens. This includes all forms of childbirth, including the use of a surrogate mother by a Citizen parent, and technologically-assisted development and birth, such as cloning. Either the mother or father may be a Citizen. The parent need not be a member of a registered household. If the child is born into a registered household and the natural parent or DNA donor for cloning is not a member of the household, any Citizen adult member of the registered household into which the child is born can provide citizenship status to the child.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> The geographical location of the birth is irrelevant. This is a difference from the present-day US system.
</p>

<a name="citbynat"/>
<h3>5.2. Citizenship By Naturalization</h3>
<p>
Naturalization is an administrative process by which an individual from another country seeks to obtain State Citizenship by choice. Statutory law will define the specific requirements and timelines for this process. When a child from abroad is adopted by American parents, the process for them to acquire Citizenship is also in this category.
</p>

<a name="cittransfer"/>
<h3>5.3. Citizenship By Transfer</h3>
<p>
This method only applies to citizens of the United States of America who choose to remain in America after the transition to the State system. They automatically become Full Citizens of the State as of a certain date (to be determined per the Transition Plan). Once the transition is complete, this category will be moot except in one special case: US citizens living abroad at the time of the transition who choose to return to America after the transition is complete will receive their State Citizenship automatically upon their return, under this category. After the last such Citizen has been processed, this category of citizenship can be removed from statutory law.
</p>

<a name="multiplecitizenship"/>
<h2>6. Multiple Citizenship</h3>
<p>
The State allows Citizens to hold dual or multiple citizenship (citizenship in other countries), but such an individual cannot become a Full Citizen. They will be Basic Citizens even if they fulfill the duties of Full Citizenship. The reason for this rule is to avoid the risks of mixed loyalties in people who may serve in government, in law enforcement, or as commissioned military officers.
</p>

<a name="relinquishingcitizenship"/>
<h2>7. Relinquishing Citizenship</h3>
<p>
The State recognizes the right of people to have a home country as a <em>human right</em>. Therefore, Basic Citizenship is permanent. 
</p>
<p>
The State cannot strip anyone of their Basic Citizenship for any reason, including the most serious of crimes.
</p>
<p>
A Citizen cannot revoke their Basic Citizenship by any act or declaration.
</p>
<p>
If a Citizen must officially renounce their citizenship in order to qualify for citizenship in a second country that does not allow dual citizenship, the renunciation will not be disputed by the State, as that would interfere with the individual's ability to live properly in the second country, but in fact the individual may return to America at any time with their Citizenship intact at home. It is the State's intent not to create any administrative or bureaucratic obstacles to this.
</p>


<a name="propertyownership"/>
<h2>8. Citizenship and Property Ownersnip</h3>
<p>
Real property in America can only be owned by Citizens. Any trickery intended to circumvent this law will be prosecuted as undermining the Three Pillars of Sovereignty, even if the offenders are careful not to violate the letter of the law.
</p>


<a name="corporations"/>
<h2>9. Citizenship and Corporations</h3>
<p>
Eighty percent (80%) or more of shares in a corporation that operates in America must be held by Citizens.
</p>
<p>
Eighty percent (80%) or more of employees and contractors of a corporation that operates in America must be Citizens.
