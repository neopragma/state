<h1>Transition Plan - Establishing the Confederacy</h1>

<p>
<a href="tr-transition.html">&lt;= Previous</a> | <a href="tr-fp-stabilization.html">Next =&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
	An unfortunate trend in the US over the past two decades or more is a large-scale movement away from democratic principles and inclusion, and toward authoritarianism and racism. Several US states - all of which were members of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War - have gradually passed legislation stripping people of legal rights and human rights, and moving closer to establishing a theocratic dictatorship as the form of government. 
</p>
<p>
	News media highlight selected government officials when reporting on this trend, but we must remember that each of those officials represents the voices of millions of voters. A significant portion of the US population today wants to eliminate democracy altogether, and to impose their preferences on everyone else by force. 
</p>
<p>
	Many US citizens proudly display insignia of sedition, such as the Confederate battle flag, and loudly announce that these insignia represent their "heritage." It is the heritage of institutionalized chattel slavery, misogyny, ignorance, superstition, xenophobia, violence, and treason. They openly align with white supremacists, anarchists, and other fringe groups. It is clear they do not wish to be part of a democratic country.
</p>
<p>
	So be it.
</p>
<p>
	The two sets of people currently living in the United States have profoundly different fundamental values that cannot be reconciled. We therefore conclude we will be happier as neighbors than as roomates.
</p>

<h3>Physical Territory of the Confederacy</h3>

<p>
	We propose to divide the territory of America into two parts - America, an inclusive and democratic nation; and the Confederacy, where those opposed to principles of inclusion and democracy can create a homeland where they feel they belong. We use the name Confederacy as a convenience; we do not know what name the residents of that new country will choose for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
	The physical territory to be ceded to the Confederacy is substantial, but does not include all the areas of the US states that separated from the United States in the 1860s. It is in America's interest to ensure the new Confederacy can succeed as a nation-state, but not in American's interest to give away too much land.
</p>
<p>
	The main offenders are the states of South Carolina, Florida, and Texas. However, those three states are not contiguous. To be successful, the Confederacy will need contiguous territory. We therefore plan to cede the territories of South Carolina, southern Georgia (excluding Atlanta and points north), Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Other member states of the original Confederacy are not included. 
</p>
<p>
	This area includes transportation and communication infrastructure, manufacturing facilities, significant agricultural land, offshore petroleum facilities, space launch facilities, international airports, seaports on both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, numerous corporate headquarters, and the headquarters of the extremist "mega-churches," which are culturally significant to Confederates. This is a generous offer; things will go very badly indeed for the Confederates if they try to take more.
</p>

<h3>Transition to Confederate Independence</h3>

<p>
	The transition from the US to the State will require time. We anticipate a Transition period of between 15 and 17 years to establish the State. The establishment of the Confederacy as a viable nation-state can be completed smoothly and peacefully within that time frame. It need not extend for decades. However, the transition has to begin immediately, as there is a great deal to be done. 
</p>
<p>
	This allows ample time for Confederate leaders to establish connections with other national governments so they can begin to build independent international relationships, to set up the infrastructure and administrative apparatus they will need to operate independently, and to return or pay for national assets owned by the American people that are located within their territory. 
</p>

<h3>Migration To and From Confederate Territory</h3>

<p>
	During the same time period, individual Americans who are philosophically aligned with Confederate values can relocate their homes and businesses there.  Conversely, residents of the new Confederate territory who are philosophically aligned with American values can relocate to wherever they wish within American territory. We believe the majority of Americans-at-heart already live outside the Confederate region, and the majority of Confederates-at-heart live within it. Yet, there are many exceptions, and they will need time to decide what they wish to do, and do it.
</p>
<p>
	There is a consideration people must understand when choosing where to live after the Transition. State law provides that US citizenship automatically conveys to State citizenship. We consider that individuals who display the insignia of rebellion and insurrection and who speak of overthrowing the US government and replacing democracy with their own flavor of authoritarianism have, by so doing, renounced their US citizenship. They will not automatically become State citizens after the Transition. That means they cannot own real property in America, even if they owned it before the Transition. 
</p>
<p>	
	If such a person wishes to live in America long-term, they must apply for legal residency and later for citizenship in order to own real property here. Otherwise, they must rent. As legal residents, they will be eligible to work and for basic social services, but they will have no voice in government. They may retain the insignia of rebellion thay possess, but not display them in a way that suggests they are trying to build support for a revolution. The items may be considered collectibles. The individuals will be well-advised not to give the State reason to suspect otherwise. They will be on a list and they will be watched.
</p>
<p>
	It is also possible that Americans who disagree with Confederate values, but who currently live in that region, may wish to remain there for personal reasons. The State has nothing to say about how such people will be treated under Confederate rule. They must understand that they will be outside the State's protection, and subject to whatever treatment the Confederacy may reserve for them.
</p>

<h3>American National Assets in Confederate Areas</h3>

<p>
	It is the State's policy that the Confederacy does not automatically inherit any assets or property that is collectively owned by the citizens of America. During the Transition, the two countries must determine the disposition of such assets and property. The transfer of American military assets to America is non-negotiable. Other assets and properties may be sold or leased to the Confederacy or dismantled/destroyed in situ. 
</p>
<p>
	In some cases, the State may simply leave assets where they are without asking for compensation. The obvious example is transportation infrastructure - the Interstate highway system and railroad lines. Another example is energy infrastructure - the power grid and electrical generating facilities of all types. Texas already has a separate electrical grid, but the other Confederate states do not. 
</p>
<p>
	It is crticially important to avoid another Sherman's March. The Confederacy must become a viable, functioning country. This is in America's interest, as the Confederacy is geographically adjacent to America and therefore is in the inner ring of foreign countries. If it is weak or non-viable as a state, foreign actors will be able to take advantage of that.
</p>
<p>
	The Confederacy will be an important neighbor to America, and a welcome trade partner. As such, the Confederacy will be eligible for significant economic assistance from America. Our general policy to engage with other countries without criticizing their internal human rights records will play in their favor. They will be free to treat minorities, women, and children however they please; to ban books and limit freedom of speech; to expel immigrants and build border walls; and to craft school curricula that teach a false history, all without damaging the rest of America, and without any interference <em>from</em> America. It is a win-win solution.
</p>
<p>
	The Confederacy will also bear the sole non-negotiable responsibility we require from all our neighbors: They must not allow hostile foreign actors to use their territory as a base for any actions that might undermine the Three Pillars of Independence. As the Texans might say: That is a conversation they don't want to have.
