<h1>What are human needs?</h1>
<p>
Human needs are the things human beings require to survive and thrive. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, due to the way many Americans tend to react to any suggestion of helping others, we must explain slowly, using small words, that merely to <em>mention</em> human needs does not imply we consider it the government's responsibility to <em>provide</em> everything people need. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, doing so would rob people of one of their basic needs - the need to accomplish something and feel good about their hard work. It is the definition of "nanny state," which is anathematic to American cultural values.
</p>
<p>
We <em>do</em> consider it a responsibility of the State to <em>establish and maintain the conditions</em> whereby people can provide for their own needs. That may include helping people from time to time.

<h2>Understanding human needs</h2>	

<p>
Psychologist Abraham Maslow came up with a five-tier model of human needs in 1943 that still seems relevant today. He divided the needs into <em>deficit needs</em> and <em>growth needs</em>. The difference is significant for the purpose of defining the appropriate role of the State in meeting human needs. 
</p>

<h3>Deficit needs and the role of the State</h3>

<p>
<em>Deficit needs</em> reflect the absence of something that is necessary. For example, if a person is hungry, they need to find food. The longer they remain hungry, the more urgently they need food and the more likely it is they will do something radical to get it. When they have sufficient food, they can turn their attention to more-interesting things, and will probably have less incentive to misbehave.
</p>
<p>
Because of the way deficit needs function in humans, the lack of a deficit need - if widespread in the population and continuing over a long time - can destabilize the country. As a key purpose of the State is <em>sustainable</em> freedom, providing for people's deficit needs becomes a practical means of sustaining the State. 
</p>
<p>
In Maslow's model, the deficit needs are:
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Physiological</li>
		<li>Safety</li>
		<li>Love/belonging</li>
		<li>Esteem</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
It is not a responsibility of the State to satisfy the deficit needs of the entire population directly. It <em>is</em> a responsibility of the State to establish and maintain the conditions whereby these needs can be met easily and sustainably.
</p>
<p>
The State helps with <em>physiological</em> needs through tax-supported universal health care services, the guaranteed minimum income, the tax-funded retirement program, and tax incentives to encourage private entities to provide charity to the poor and assistance to those down on their luck. 
</p>
<p>
The State helps with <em>safety</em> needs by providing for national security against foreign enemies, law enforcement services for protection against domestic criminals, and laws enabling people to defend themselves, their families, and their property.
</p>
<p>
The State helps with <em>love/belonging</em> needs by providing positive socialization in public schools, by rewarding voluntary community service and military service, and by encouraging and supporting "bread and circuses" for the population. 
</p>
<p>
The State helps with <em>esteem</em> needs through a graduated system of rewards and recognition for achievement, recognition for outstanding community or military service, and by supporting "bread and circuses" for the population.
</p>
<p>
References to "bread and circuses" reflect the importance of the neurotransmitter, serotonin, in regulating mood and generating a sense of well-being. For example, when your favorite sports team scores a goal or wins a game, your own brain generates serotonin. You feel like a "winner," even though you didn't play in the game yourself and you had no role in training or coaching the team. The importance of this sort of thing for human happiness cannot be overstated. 
</p>
<p>
In terms of Systems Thinking, by keeping the population generally "happy," the State creates a <em>reinforcing loop</em> that strengthens its ability to uphold human rights, legal rights, and the Three Pillars of Independence. The State supports the people and the people support the State, for their own benefit. The State does not exist in opposition to or in conflict with the people. 
</p>

<h3>Growth needs and the role of the State</h3>

<p>
<em>Growth needs</em> are necessary for people to achieve their goals in life or to become the type of person they aspire to be. In Maslow's model, the only growth need is <em>Self-actualization</em>; that is, becoming the person you are "meant" to be. He suggests it is not possible for people to pursue self-actualization unless the underlying deficit needs are more-or-less taken care of. They don't have to be taken care of to perfection, but they must not be a "problem" for the person.
</p>
<p>
One of the errors that seems to be built into the current cultural framework in the US is the assumption that every individual has a "passion" in life and a desire to "grow." The reality is that some people have this feeling and others do not. Many people will be happy if they have a steady job that pays well enough that they can pay for their living expenses, no worries about health care or retirement, and "circuses" to keep them entertained and enable them to generate serotonin. They have no particular aspirations beyond that. 
</p>
<p>
The State supports these different individual needs through a system of education and employment that provides one track for the more-ambitious people and another for those who want to become employable and start living as adults sooner rather than later. The education system is described elsewhere.
