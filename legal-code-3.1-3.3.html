	3. Humanity and the Law
	<br/>
	The Constitution is largely based on human rights and the State's duties to the people in that regard. This section of the legal code pertains to that subject.

</p>
<p class="indent">
	3.1. An individual is <em>human</em> and therefore imbued with <em>human rights</em> and entitled to <em>legal rights</em> throughout the lifespan defined in the Constitution. This applies to all persons within the jurisdicton of the State regardless of Citizenship, Residency, or Visa status and regardless of criminal convictions.
	<br/>
	<span class="indent2">CR: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
	3.2. Organizations of any kind, including corporations, non-profits, religions, labor unions, clubs, governmental entities, or any other type of organization not listed here, are <em>not</em> considered "human" for purposes of statutory law. Incorporation or registration of an organization will not serve as a legal shield to protect decision-makers in the organization from the legal consequences of their actions.

	3.3.1. When an individual is capable of upholding their own human rights, no other individual or organization may override that individual's choices regarding their own human rights.

</p>
<p class="indent2">
	3.3.2. When an individual is <em>not</em> capable of upholding their own human rights, the decisions of their healthcare proxy or legal proxy have the same force as if the individual had made the decision under Statute 3.3.1. If no proxy is registered, then the responsibility falls to the nearest living relative who is mentally competent. If no such individual exists or they cannot be found or they explicitly refuse to serve as proxy, then the State will act as proxy.

</p>
<p class="indent2">
	3.3.3. A woman who becomes pregnant and carries the pregnancy successfully to the point that the Constitution defines as the beginning of the human lifespan automatically becomes the healthcare and legal proxy for the unborn child. She remains the default and primary proxy for the child until the child reaches the age of majority. No administrative procedure is required to establish this relationship; however, a different proxy may be assigned should the woman prove to be an unfit parent, or should she choose to surrender this responsibility.

</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.3.3.1. Corollary: The natural father of the unborn child as described in Statute 3.3.3 shares responsibility for the child's welfare. Should the father fail to fulfill his duties to the child, then the mother or her legal proxy may ask the State to require child support payments beginning from the time of fetal viability and extending until the child's 16th birthday.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.3.3.2. Corollary: Should the pregnancy be a result of (a) forcible rape or (b) abuse of a minor, then the natural father is not permitted to serve as the healthcare proxy or legal proxy of the child; however, he is still considered financially responsible under Statute 3.3.3.1.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	3.3.4. Should a pregnancy end unsuccessfully subsequent to the point of viability by a natural process that was not caused by the woman's free choice of reckless action (such as consuming alcohol while pregnant), there is no violation of the human rights of the unborn child, regardless of the stage of development at the point the pregnancy ends. This provision applies to miscarriages and stillbirths.

<p class="indent3">
3.3.6.6. Health Proxy Decision
<p class="indent3">
	In carrying out their duties, if a health proxy can show they acted with due diligence they will not be charged when they make the decision to terminate the life of the individual under their care. An investigation is mandatory when a health proxy makes this decision.
