<h1>America</h1>
<p>
This set of documents describes a model of government intended to establish a viable and sustainable independent homeland for the people residing in the nation-state known as The United States of America ("US") in the 2020s. It is a response to the serious and growing problems in the US as of the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>
This is not an academic work based on scholarly references, although we refer to published sources from time to time. It is a practical model based on (a) assessment of the general characteristics of Americans, and (b) observations of present-day reality, human nature, common everyday behaviors exhibited by Americans as they go about their lives, and the challenges and opportunities Americans find in the world. 
</p>
<p>
The proposed model is not based on traditional Western political theories like communism, fascism, and democracy. It begins by asking, What is the single most important factor for high quality of life, from the American point of view? The answer to that question is: Individual liberty.
</p>
<p>
Individual liberty may not be important - or indeed of any interest at all - to people other than Americans, or to Americans who lived in a past era, or to Americans who may live in some future world that has different parameters than our own. We are not trying to solve the problems of all people in all cultures for all time; just those of Americans in the present era.
</p>
<p>
The follow-up question is: What is necessary for Americans to enjoy individual liberty to the greatest extent practical on a sustainable basis? 
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the proposed political system is to support that goal; nothing more. 
</p>
<p>
It is explicitly <em>not</em> an attempt to impose a favorite ideology on Americans. Our approach is not ideologically-driven - and we include under this heading every political, social, humanistic, and religious ideology or belief system. It is a straightforward attempt to arrive at a practical solution that can provide Americans with maximum individual liberty for the long term. 
</p>
<p>
If it seems to you that we repeat this idea excessively, please bear in mind it is very difficult for most people to break out of conventional political thinking along the lines of "right vs. left." Even to contemplate the existence of a frame of reference other than "right vs. left" is nearly impossible for most Americans, and quite possibly for people of any Western culture. That model is deeply ingrained; and yet the belief in that model and the reduction of every issue to its terms lie at the root of many of our problems. 
</p>
<p>
We do not expect or desire that all Americans think and feel the same way; just that each is free to live as they please, short of interfering with anyone else's ability to do the same. We don't imagine these ideas represent a perfect system, but unfortunately the present condition of the US sets a low bar for improvement.
