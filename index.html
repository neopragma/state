<h1>America</h1>  
<p>
This set of documents describes a model of government intended to establish a viable and sustainable independent homeland for the people residing in the nation-state known as The United States of America ("US") in the 2020s. It is a response to the serious and growing problems in the US as of the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>
We begin by asking, What is the single most important factor for high quality of life, from the American point of view? Based on Americans' behavior and statements, the answer to that question appears to be: Individual liberty.
</p>
<p>
The follow-up question is: What is necessary for Americans to enjoy individual liberty to the greatest extent practical on a sustainable basis? 
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the proposed political system is to support that goal. 
</p>
