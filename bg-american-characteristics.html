<h1>Backgrounder on the Characteristics of Americans</h1>

<p>
The political model is not meant to be a universal solution for all countries and nations; it is meant to serve Americans. The State must accommodate the cultural values and needs of Americans. Therefore, it is important to understand the general characteristics of the American people. 
</p>
<p>
We want to understand (a) what Americans want and need from their government or their "system," and (b) what sort of government or "system" Americans are capable of operating and sustaining.

<h2>1. Sources of Information</h2>

<p>
Americans tend to see themselves as exceptional, heroic, unique in history, and invariably the Good Guys. Others tend to see Americans as arrogant, violent, selfish, and ignorant. Those assessments strike us as subjective, emotional, judgmental, and probably motivated by goals or needs other than an accurate understanding of Americans. Americans want to feel good about themselves, while many others around the world want to find a scapegoat for their own problems, and turn to whichever country happens to be the leading global power at the moment. 
</p>
<p>
These assessments cannot help us understand how the State can serve the true needs of Americans. They begin with a conclusion already decided, and then back-fill observations and assertions to support it. Yet, it is useful to understand how Americans perceive themselves, as well as how others perceive them. 
</p>
<p>
To gain a more objective understanding of Americans, we rely on various theories and models of human development and behavior. The main theories we rely on are Geert Hofstede's <em>Cultural Dimensions Theory</em> and Jane Loevinger's theory of the <em>Stages of Ego Development</em>. Those two are relatively robust and credible, supported by social science research over a period of many years.

<h2>2. How Americans See Themselves</h2>

This section contains statements by Americans about America and themselves as a people.

<a name="exceptionalism"/>
<h3>2.1. American Exceptionalism</h3>

<p>
Possibly the single most influential concept that defines Americans' self-image is the notion of <em>American Exceptionalism</em>. The concept originated with the country, during Revolutionary War times, although the precise term was not used until the late 1920s, in internal debates among American Communists. Previously, the concept was known simply as Americanism. The idea has been described and debated widely since the formation of the US, and has always been a driving force in US policy.
</p>
<p>
The Wikipedia article on the subject summarizes the idea well (article found on May 28, 2022): "American exceptionalism is the idea that the United States is inherently different from other nations. Its proponents argue that the values, political system, and historical development of the U.S. are unique in human history, often with the implication that the country is both destined and entitled to play a distinct and positive role on the world stage."
</p>
<p>
Political scientist Seymour Lipset defines Americanism as based on liberty, equality before the law, individual responsibility, republicanism, and laissez-faire economics. Although some of these characteristics may be aspirational, Americans assume their country is based on these values and, as such, it is superior to other nations. 
</p>
<p>
That said, very few Americans know the history of the phrase, "American Exceptionalism," and would be unable to enumerate its ideas (as given by Lipset) if asked. Their understanding of the phrase is simply, "We're better than everyone else." That would be bad enough, but Americans have taken their assumptions a step further: They assume every place outside the US is a Stone Age nightmare, lacking clean drinking water, electricity, and roads.
</p>
<p>
Our observation: <em>The belief in their inherent superiority has led Americans to ignore the rest of the world, resulting in general ignorance of history, economics, history, foreign languages, and other cultures, as well as profoundly damaging effects on other countries. Most Americans are oblivious to these facts. To a great extent, this widespread ignorance is due to the version of history presented in US public school systems.</em>
</p>
<p>
Belief in American Exceptionalism is deeply ingrained in the culture. Most Americans are unable to see any flaw, or even to consider the possibility of a potential imperfection in their country, even when faced directly with information that contradicts the belief. The following comments by Texas Senator Ted Cruz are representative of American thinking. 
</p>
<p>
During a brief interview with Mark Stone of Sky News on Wednesday, May 25, 2022, Sen. Cruz responded to a question about the reasons mass shootings are concentrated in the US, and occur nowhere else, by exclaiming angrily, "Why is it that people come from all over the world to America? Because it's the freest, most prosperous, safest country on Earth." When Stone asked why "this aspect" of American exceptionalism is "so awful," the Senator replied, "I'm sorry you think American exceptionalism is awful."
</p>
<p>
Our observation: <em>Is it logical to say that the only country where mass shootings are a common occurrence is also safest country on Earth? We think there is a logical contradiction in this. Clearly, Sen. Cruz literally </em>cannot see<em> any fault in the US, even in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting at an elementary school in his own state, capping a week that saw multiple mass shootings across the country. Most Americans share this trait with Sen. Cruz. It is a cultural blind spot.</em>
</p>

<h3>2.2. Domestic Backlash from American Exceptionalism</h3>

<p>
The American people are divided against each other, as of the time of writing. Those who have been able to question American Exceptionalism and to learn facts about US history that are avoided in public schools and popular information sources have experienced a strongly negative emotional reaction. 
</p>
<p>
The following comments are from the website debate.org, which posted the question: Could America be considered evil?
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>A brief look at some truly "un-American" episodes over the past decade may lead to the belief that the United States needs to check into a 12-step recovery plan for superstates drunk on power."</li>
	<li class="linespace">"American decisions probably have the widest-reaching impact. Whenever this has negative results on people, that decision, and the people behind it, can be considered 'evil'."</li>
	<li class="linespace">"Yes so evil 
		<br/>1. Genocide of natives.
        <br/>2. Only country to use nuclear weapon.
        <br/>3. Black chattel slavery that lasted longer than any other white nation. Still racist to this day.
        <br/>4. Does not invest in education so their population remains ignorant of real history.
        <br/>5. No universal health care which most other 1st world countries have.
        <br/>6. Fox News - nuff said"</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In a 2016 article on <em>The Blaze</em>, a US conservative news and opinion site, Kimberly Fletcher wrote, "Following Independence Day, Dennis Prager lamented, 'This Fourth of July weekend, there were a spate of opinion pieces arguing how bad America is and how immoral its founding.' He then asked a very powerful question, 'Can America survive if its own people despise it?'"
</p>
<p>
We could continue with hundreds and hundreds of examples of very similar opinions. 
</p>
<p>
The reason the backlash is so strong when Americans begin to learn their true history is that they have been mentally and emotionally primed from a young age to think of America as perfect. When the Perfect Thing is revealed to be imperfect after all, the True Believer recoils and turns against what he previously worshipped. It is not sufficient for the Perfect Thing to have some flaws that can be corrected. It must be entirely Good or entirely Evil. 
</p>
<p>
The problem is the "worship." If Americans were taught a balanced and objective version of history, they would be equipped to understand the negative aspects of the country in proper context, and prepared to improve the situation going forward. Instead, the reaction is along the lines of "Oh, no! God is only a stone idol! Now life itself has no purpose or meaning at all!" 
</p>
<p>
In reality, no country is perfect. Of course, if America is also imperfect, then what happens to American exceptionalism? Americans would have to come to grips with the fact they are not special. If they are not special, then what is their place in the world, really? It is a hard pill to swallow.
</p>
<p>
The divide between Americans who are unable to face reality and those who face it but can't handle it may be the downfall of the country. We need to face reality...<em>and</em> handle it. The public education program described in our political model addresses this problem. 
</p>

<a name="selfmade"/>
<h3>2.3. The Myth of the Self-Made Man</h3>

<p>
Americans talk about Critical Thinking, but few apply it. Most Americans are unaware of Systems Thinking, and <em>very</em> few apply it. Ignorance in this general area may be a reason many Americans never think about the "system" of which they are a part, and how that system creates opportunity and benefits for them throughout their lives. Typically, Americans assume any success they have achieved is a result of their own individual effort, and they have received no help in any form, direct or indirect, from any person or institution, nor from "the system" as a whole. 
</p>
<p>
	Taking this idea beyond the point of diminishing returns (a recurring theme in American culture), many Americans conclude they do not owe anything to their fellow countrymen - no financial help with things like healthcare or education, and not even basic respect for anyone else's rights. It comes down to "every man for himself," or "only the strong shall survive," or "pull yourself up by your bootstraps," or "it must be God's will that you should suffer." Ironically, nearly everyone who says these things is a full-time employee of a corporation they do not own - the diametric opposite of "self-made" or "independent."
</p>
<p>
Only a vanishingly small number of Americans, compared to the total population, even <em>attempt</em> to live fully independently, "off the grid." Even <em>they</em> are far from fully independent. They must take odd jobs occasionally and make purchases of certain items, and most of them require some practical form of transportation besides their own feet. They may well repair and maintain their own vehicle, but they do not manufacture the parts or produce the oil, fuel, and other specialized fluids the vehicle requires, nor build the roads it traverses. 
</p>
<p>
	Very few, if any, personally grow, hunt, or fish <em>all</em> of their own food. Almost none make their own clothes, let alone the textiles from which clothing is made. They may build their own house or cabin, but they do not produce the building materials and prefabriated parts, the tools and fasteners and insulation and adhesives and roofing materials and window glass. They may reload their own ammunition, but they did not make their gun, nor the metal alloys of which it is manufactured. They wear shoes they did not make, travel on roads they did not build, read Bibles they did not print, impressed onto paper they did not make with ink they did not produce, attend schools they did not organize and learn from teachers they did not train. If they have a fire, they call the fire department. If they need protection, they call the police department. The country they live in is defended by professional military forces, not by themselves personally and individually. And yet, they do not "owe" anything to anyone. They are self-made.
</p>
<p>
	Everyone who has achieved anything at all in life has done so through their own effort - but not <em>solely</em> through their own effort. Individual determination and perseverance are necessary, but not sufficient for success. Everyone receives help from other people - parents, teachers, clergy members, friends, mentors, role models, the authors of the books they read. Everyone makes use of opportunities provided by "the system" in which they live - transportation and communication infrastructure, public libraries, the Internet, public schools, religious institutions, entitlement programs, historical and racial privilege or, if they happen to be of the "wrong" race, affirmative action programs. 
</p>
<p>
	The importance of individualism in American culture has gone beyond the point of diminishing returns. In the present-day US, about half the population sincerely believes they need no one else and no assistance of any kind to live prosperously and with unrestricted personal freedom, indefinitely. 
</p>
<p>
	Another common myth in America, probably arising in part from runaway individualism, is the idea that luck is not a factor in success. The reality is that luck plays a large role in life. You may be independent-minded, determined, educated, well-prepared, and ready to take advantage of opportunities - but if conditions beyond your control don't allow it, you will get nowhere. 
</p>
<p>
	The truth is there is no such thing as a "self-made man," in America or anywhere else. It is only by becoming part of something larger than oneself that an individual can reach their full potential in life; and to be part of something larger than yourself, you must give to the "something" and not just take from it. Taxes pay for transportation infrastructure, national defense, public education, and many other things that benefit Americans. You cannot refuse to pay taxes and also have those benefits. Citizens must also contribute their personal time and effort; they must be <em>engaged</em> with the system to keep it working. They must participate in voting and serve on juries, maintain their property and do their part to keep the streets clean. Yet, many Americans think they can maintain a prosperous and free lifestyle without making any contribution to the whole.
</p>
<p>
	This aspect of Americans' self-image is completely fictional, and has profoundly damaged American society.
</p>


<a name="valueworth"/>
<h3>2.4. Human Value Equated to Financial Worth</h3>

<p>
Americans tend to value one another based on each person's wealth. This is an outcome of 19th-century history. Following the Civil War, the power elite in the US sought to indoctrinate the public to accept the imbalance of wealth and power as normal, and to submit to it peacefully. Public schools were established with curricula designed to achieve this goal. Ministers preached this message from the pulpit. 
</p>
<p>
Influential speakers, such as Russell Conwell, propagated the myth that anyone could become wealthy if they worked hard enough and were honest. God Himself had placed certain individuals in positions of power because they could be trusted with wealth and power, and could guide the nation according to His will. 
</p>
<p>
Sympathy for the poor was to be discouraged, as Conwell mentioned in his talk, <em>Acres of Diamonds</em>: "To sympathize with a man whom God has punished for his sins...is to do wrong...let us remember there is not a poor person in the United States who was not made poor by his own shortcomings." 
</p>
<p>
Today, the occasional success story - Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk - lends credence to this view. Americans by the tens of millions believe that if only they are honest and work hard, they, too, may become extremely wealthy. They are hesitant to upset the system they have been conditioned to believe will enable this. 
</p>
<p>
The belief manifests in unhealthy ways. Middle-class Americans try to "keep up with the Joneses" by purchasing items of equal or greater cost than their neighbors. Many families have gone bankrupt by following this lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
Many Americans, from bored teenagers to police officers, routinely harass, beat, or even kill street people. One of the underlying causes of this behavior is the ingrained belief that wealth equates to goodness and poverty equates to pesonal failure or "sin." Some young people who have been arrested for beating or killing street people explained they had heard their parents at home describing street people as "garbage" that should be "taken out."
</p>


<a name="backvalue"/>
<h3>2.5. Backlash Against Human Value Equated to Financial Worth</h3>

<p>
Many Americans have the oppposite feelings about the tendency to equate human value with financial worth: They despise anyone who has more wealth than they. In our view, this is both a direct consequence of the emphasis on financial worth <em>and</em> a reaction against it. To the extent Americans feel inadequate or unsuccessful because they lack wealth, the attitude is a direct consequence of this cultural norm. To the extent Americans feel the ultra-wealthy exploit the general populace without much accountability, it is a backlash against the same cultural norm.  
</p>
<p>
Americans tend not to distinguish between the power elite and individuals who happen to find financial success in life. In part, this may be due to the success of propaganda that has convinced the majority of Americans there is no such thing as a "power elite." In part, it may be an example of Americans' general inability to assess information critically. 
</p>
<p>
The power elite is associated with family names like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan. Names like Gates, Jobs, and Musk are not in the same category, even if their business success has resulted in a certain level of influence. 
</p>
<p>
The danger lies in "throwing out the baby with the bathwater." If those who categorically oppose wealth accumulation in any form succeed in removing all opportunity for personal reward, they will stifle innovation and economic activity. It has been demonstrated that an excessive wealth gap is a sign of impending societal collapse - see the work of Peter Turchin and others in the field of cliodynamics for more information - but Americans' backlash against the wealthy is not based on an academic understanding of these factors. It is an emotional response to the fact "they" have more money than "I." The only reason this is important to Americans is that they have been indoctrinated, since at least the middle of the 19th century, to equate the value of a human being with his or her personal wealth. Given time and focused educational programs, this harmful social norm can be changed.
</p>
<p>
<em>Aside:</em> Cliodynamics does play a role in the definition of the State, as we want to control the growth of the wealth gap to avoid the predictable (disastrous) consequences, but we also want to be sure people have opportunity to create, innovate, and build, and that they are rewarded for it.
</p>


<a name="others"/>
<h2>3. How Others See Americans</h2>

<p>
What is interesting for our purposes is the disparity between Americans' self-image and foreigners' perceptions of America and its people. By understanding the gap in perception, we seek to define realistic policies without making the assumption everyone will respond in the way we want them to respond. We need to understand how our behavior affects the world. To do that, we must free ourselves from the mindset of American Exceptionalism.
</p>
<p>
Foreign perceptions of America are a mixed bag. In parts of the world that have been harmed by American foreign policy, military interventions, or interference in domestic politics, the view is strongly negative. In parts of the world that have benefited from American economic or military support, the view is positive.
</p>


<a name="iran"/>
<h3>3.1. An Example: Iran and the United States</h3>

<p>
Probably the best-known example of foreign hatred is the characterization of the US as "the Great Satan" in Iran. Historically, this is understood as a reaction to a series of interventions in Iranian internal matters, going back as far as 1907 (US and Britain) and culminating in the 1953 ouster of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq by the CIA (US) and MI6 (UK) to prevent his government from nationalizing the highly lucrative petroleum industry in Iran. 
</p>
<p>
The US and UK installed former Shah Reza Pahlavi, who immediately declared all Iranian assets were his personal property. To try and maintain control of the petroleum reserves and facilities, the US passed the Status of Forces Bill in the 1960s, granting US military personnel diplomatic immunity for any human rights violations or other crimes they might commit in defense of the petroleum industry. 
</p>
<p>
The backlash came in 1979 with the so-called Islamic Revolution, known in America as "the Iran hostage crisis." The chant, "Death to America" became popular, and the term "Great Satan" was coined. Iran instituted an annual celebration called "Death to America Day," which they still celebrate today, to keep their hatred alive. 
</p>
<p>
Iran is an extreme case, but not the only example of an entire nation that viscerally hates the US. The idea that anyone could viscerally hate the US comes as a shock to Americans when they first hear of it. Many Americans never quite come to believe it. After all, they've been assured throughout their lives that the US is fundamentally good, and a beacon to the world.
</p>

<a name="hubris"/>
<h3>3.2. Hubris Coupled with Immense Military and Economic Power</h3>

<p>
Many people around the world admire the US for its engineering and scientific achievements - first to the Moon, defeated Polio, generally clean water in most of the country, impressive infrastructure such as dams and highways, etc. Many people like American culture, especially popular music, casual clothing, entertainment, and food. They respect American achievements in the fine arts, sports, medicine, and scientific research. 
</p>
<p>
Yet, at the same time, they are puzzled by America's hubris, and worried about the fact this hubris is supported by the world's largest military machine, funded by the world's most robust economy, and driven by the belief that America is <em>inherently superior</em> and <em>entitled</em> to exercise any and all means to dominate the world. 
</p>
<p>
Pride in country is a good thing, but like other good things it can be taken too far. Officially and institutionally, the US has no respect for any other nation. For example, President Lyndon Johnson told the Greek prime minister in the 1970s to do as America wished; when the prime minister replied that it was up to the Greek parliament to decide, Pres. Johnson said, "Fuck your parliament." Five decades later, the attitude had not changed. President Donald Trump (2016-2020) is on record as characterizing a significant portion of the world as "shithole countries."
</p>
<p>
Europeans remember America's contribution to defeating the Nazis in the 1940s, and hold deep respect for the many who gave their lives in that cause. They maintain American cemeteries on their own soil, and conduct annual remembrances of the sacrifices the soldiers made for them. 
</p>
<p>
But they also remember that America stood back and watched while the Nazis ran roughshod over Europe for four years before they finally stepped up. And they remember America only stepped up after its own territory was attacked. They also remember that in the 1940s, and still today, a significant number of Americans are sympathetic to Nazi values and beliefs.
</p>

<a name="contradictions"/>
<h3>3.3. Contradictions and Inconsistencies</h3>

<p>
On the grassroots level, foreigners hold mixed views of America. One inconsistency is that Americans seem strong and confident on the one hand, and yet on the other hand are unable to tolerate the slightest inconvenience. For example, as this is written, Russia is attempting to annex Ukraine by force, and the US (along with others) is providing material assistance to the Ukrainians and imposing economic sanctions on Russia. One consequence of this is that fuel prices have risen in the US. Americans are complaining about this to a degree that foreigners find unsupportable. With gasoline costing about $5 per gallon at the pump, it is roughly half the price of gasoline elsewhere in the world. Yet, the Americans are whining about it like babies demanding their bottle.
</p>
<p>
 There are countless examples of this general behavior pattern. Many foreigners have difficulty understanding how the same people who went to the Moon and defeated the Nazis and all the rest of it can behave in such a childish and selfish way over a temporary bump in fuel prices for a just cause, when the prices are not high at all compared to what everyone else pays. How could people of such immaturity and weak character have built such a powerful and accomplished nation? 
</p>
<p>
There are also inconsistencies between word and deed. Americans often speak of equality and freedom, and yet even today non-whites and non-Protestants are often not treated in the same way as white Protestants. The growing Christian Evangelist movement appears, from the outside, as a political power play rather than a sincere religious movement. The tenets of evangelism are obviously contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ, and on a practical level only seem to be an attempt to institutionalize class differences and racism, and to replace democratic institutions with a theocratic dictatorship. Foreigners struggle to understand how this can happen in a constitutional democracy whose Constitution explicitly prohibits the government from establishing an official religion. 
</p>
<p>
Hand in hand with the evangelists, many American politicians and their followers are keen to replace objective curriculum content in public schools with straight-up propaganda. They do not want Americans to learn the true history of the country. From the outside, this appears to be nothing less than a program to indoctrinate the next generation of soldiers to believe in American Exceptionalism and obey any and all orders, regardless of human rights. 
</p>

<a name="perceptions"/>
<h3>3.4. Perceptions on an Individual Level</h3>

<p>
After hearing about America in whatever terms are common in their places of origin, many foreigners are surprised when they first visit America or when they first have conversations with Americans beyond the superficial level. They are often pleasantly surprised to find that individual Americans are kind, generous, curious, and friendly. But this leads to more confusion, as it is completely different from the impression the country makes through its formal policies and official actions. They cannot understand how kind, generous, curious, and friendly people could have created the nation that is widely perceived as the greatest threat to peace in the world.
</p>
<p>
Foreigners who have not traveled to the US often hold unusual views about the country and its people. Visiting England as a member of an orchestra that organized a joint concert with an English orchestra, the main author was amused when the hosts asked the group if everyone wore cowboy hats and boots and carried "six guns" at home. They were not joking. Visiting Brazil on business, a Brazilian colleague drove some of us to dinner after work one day. On the way, he apologized for his small car. It was a mid-size sedan; not small. The assumption was that everything in America is "big." Americans who have been abroad have many such stories. 
</p>
<p>
Immigrants to the US provide another source of information about how Americans are perceived. Even those who visited the country several times before moving here discover numerous unexpected cultural differences. Most of these were small matters, but there were some big surprises that seem to be common to immigrants from many different countries, so they may provide some insight into the nature of Americans. 
</p>
<p>
Many people have a positive perception of America based on well-known achievements by individual Americans, American corporations, the nation collectively. They had expected a majority of Americans to be visionary, well-educated, highly-skilled, creative, and hard-working. They soon learn the achievements are the work of a minority of Americans, and most Americans are naive, poorly educated, have no particular skills to speak of and only barely manage to hold a job, are uncreative and lazy, and have virtually no understanding of economics, politics, history, or the rest of the world, or even how to assess information to judge its credibility. When they learn scientists and teachers are not paid well in America, they are at a loss to see how the country continues to operate at all. 
</p>
<p>
Another common theme has to do with women's rights and pay equity. Having seen many television shows and other reports of women's rights activities in the US, people abroad had assumed the problem was solved, and women were treated fairly in America. After moving here, they learned America has the same issues as nearly every other country with respect to women's rights and pay equity.
</p>
<p>
Depending on where the immigrant came from, they may or may not have been exposed to the dark side of American Exceptionalism. People report being surprised by the arrogance of Americans. Some say the combination of this arrogance with the general ignorance of the people is particularly grating; some degree of arrogance might be acceptable if it were justified, and yet most Americans they meet are hardly "superior" to anyone in any way.
</p>
<p>
Another surprising area for immigrants is political corruption. In many parts of the world, people assume America is "clean" in the sense that its politicians genuinely care about the country and the people and act in their best interests. They discover that politicians in America are approximately as corrupt as politicians anywhere else. They are no <em>worse</em> than politicians anywhere else, but because America presents itself as "perfect," the contrast with reality can be jarring. Some consider the practice of "lobbying," regarded as normal in America, as a form of corruption. 
</p>
<p>
Many immigrants (and visitors) find one of Americans' customs very odd indeed: Sports teams huddle together before a game and pray together. Others have reported that the intensity of religious belief in America was surprising to them. Many cultures are religious; that is not unusual in itself. What newcomers find contradictory is the combination of the Constitutional separation of church and state and the everyday fervor of religious believers. It is not only the level of religiosity that surprises people, but the fact there is strong social pressure to conform with one particular religious tradition - fundamentalist Christianity. Relatively little acceptance or tolerance of other faiths is evident in the everyday behavior of most Americans, despite their Constitution.

<h3>3.5. Foreign Perception of America by the Numbers</h3>

<p>
It is a commonplace (in the US) to hear that the US is "the greatest country that has ever existed." If that is true, it should be borne out by the numbers. In a report published in <em>US News and World Report</em> on January 23, 2018, by David Reibstein and Suneal Bedi, the results of two surveys are summarized. They are two of the Wharton "Best Countries" surveys, which measure people's perceptions of the world's nation-states. One was taken before the 2016 Presidential election, and the other was taken after that election.
</p>
<p>
Just prior to the 2016 election, Wharton surveyed 21,000 people around the world concerning 80 countries. The survey collects 75 metrics weighted by their correlation with gross domestic product per capita. On the whole, the US ranked as the fourth-best country in the world at that time. Other highlights: The US was perceived as the 13th most economically stable country, and 33rd in terms of desirability for investment. It was ranked 9th for gender equality, 20th for open travel policies, and 16th in environmental policies.
</p>
<p>
Donald Trump's presidential campaign was based on the slogan, "Make America Great Again," and it brought forward the attitude of American Exceptionalism in an extreme way. Various radical groups were encouraged to come forward, including neo-Nazis, white supremacists, white nationalists, and others with broadly similar views. As a result, in the next "Best Countries" survey, the US dropped from 11th to 21st in political stability, and from 17th to 23rd in trustworthiness.
</p>
<p>
By 2018, the US had fallen further in key categories. Its overall ranking fell from 4th to 8th. In the "open for business" category, the US fell from 35th to 43rd. In transparency or trustworthiness, global perception of the US government fell from 13th to 18th. In womens equality, the US fell from 9th to 14th. In terms of political equality for minorities, the US dropped from 7th to 16th. In the area of environmental stewardship, the US went from 24th to 31st. Possibly due to the vitriolic opposition to immigration of the Trump administration, the US dropped from 20th to 51st in open travel policies. These changes occurred in a short time - between 2016 and 2018.
</p>
<p>
It seems unlikely "the greatest country that has ever existed" would be perceived in this way by the rest of the world.

<h2>4. Assessing Americans' Behavior</h2>

<p>
Up to this point, all we have are subjective impressions - Americans' self-image and foreigners' assumptions. There is an old saying, "Actions speak louder than words." If we want to understand Americans - not their opinions of themselves, but how they really are - we need to use methods that do not depend on subjective factors. How do Americans tend to behave, and what can we learn from this that will be useful in defining a political model that achieves the purpose of the State?
</p>

<a name="hofstede"/>
<h3>4.1. Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions</h3>

<p>
We will start with Geert Hofestede's model of cultures. A comprehensive description of the model would be out of place here. You can find a good summary with concise explanations of the meaning of the elements of the model here: <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/hofstedes-cultural-dimensions-theory/">https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/hofstedes-cultural-dimensions-theory</a>. If you want to see the "official" scores by country, you can find them here: <a href="https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/the-usa/">https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/the-usa/</a>. A great deal of published material is available, which you can find on your own if interested.
</p>

<a name="powerdist"/>
<h4>4.1.1. Power Distance Index</h4>

<p>
The Power Distance Index reflects the general attitude of people in a culture to accept inequality and differences in power, from the point of view of those who lack power. A culture with a high value accepts power differences and accepts bureaucracy as normal. A culture with a low value prefers flat organizational structures and decentralized decision-making authority. 
</p>
<p>
The score for the US is 40 on a scale of 100. This is a middle-of-the-road score, tending toward the egalitarian end of the spectrum. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Our observation</em>
</p>
<p>
The score corresponds with our assessment of Americans, based on their behavior. There is a pull toward egalitarianism, but a significant number of Americans - we would say almost half - really want someone else to tell them what is true and what they should do. They want rules to follow, and they are not too concerned about exactly what the rules say or whether they bring anything of value to the table. This trait has been exploited in recent years by the Republican Party and former President Donald Trump.
</p>
<p>
A slight majority are less tolerant of bureacracy and formal authority. They are willing to follow rules, but the rules must make sense to them and must seem "fair." Also, the purpose of the rules must be clear, and there must be a mechanism in place to change rules that people deem unacceptable or inappropriate. These Americans will follow authority provided those in power are transparent about how they operate.
</p>

<a name="individualism"/>
<h4>4.1.2. Individualism vs. Collectivism</h4>

<p>
This dimension concerns the relative importance of the individual and groups to which individuals may belong. A high score means the culture is more focused on individual needs and goals than on group needs and goals. 
</p>
<p>
The score for the US is 92 on a scale of 100. This is an extreme individualistic value. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Our observation</em>
</p>
<p>
This finding is in line with our observations about American behavior. 
</p>

<a name="uncertainty"/>
<h4>4.1.3. Uncertainty Avoidance Index</h4>

<p>
A high score in this dimension suggests the culture is risk-averse and uncomfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty. A low score suggests the culture is open to taking risks and tolerant of uncertainty. 	
</p>
<p>
The score for the US is 46 on a scale of 100.
</p>
<p>
<em>Our observation</em>
</p>
<p>
The score puts the US in the middle of the spectrum with respect to uncertainty and risk. We do not know whether this is because Americans may tolerate risk under some circumstances and not others, or because half of Americans are strongly risk-averse and the other half eager risk-takers, or some other reason. 
</p>

<a name="masculinity"/>
<h4>4.1.4. Masculinity vs. Femininity</h4>

<p>
According to this model, a masculine culture has distinct gender roles and focuses on material achievements, and is characterized by assertiveness and a desire to accumulate wealth. A feminine culture has fluid gender roles and is primarily concerned with quality of life. 
</p>
<p>
The score for the US is 62 on a scale of 100, where higher scores indicate masculinity.
</p>
<p>
<em>Our observation</em>
</p>
<p>
We observe an almost single-minded focus on material success and wealth-building, and extreme assertiveness corresponding with the attitude of American Exceptionalism and the myth of the self-made man. 
</p>
<p>
For example, power elites in the US have systematically denied climate change, knowing that to take no action on that problem was to invite catastrophic damage that might not be survivable for the human species. They did this because they stood to make slightly more profit in the short term if they avoided investing in climate management. In addition, many Americans describe the value of <em>human beings</em> strictly in terms of how much money they have or how much money they earn in a month or a year. It seems as if American culture places no value on any other factors. Corporations almost universally refer to their employees as "resources," and treat them more as machine parts than as people. We think the score of 62 is too low. It does not reflect reality.
</p>

<a name="longterm"/>
<h4>4.1.5. Long-term vs. Short-term Orientation</h4>

<p>
Cultures with long-term orientation routinely delay gratification to achieve long-term goals. They exercise persistence and patience. Cultures with short-term orientation seek immediate rewards and may give little or no thought to longer-term consequences. Higher scores correspond with long-term orientation. 
</p>
<p>
The score for the US is 26 on a scale of 100.
</p>
<p>
<em>Our observation</em>
</p>
<p>
The result corresponds with our observations of American behavior. 
</p>

<a name="indulgence"/>
<h4>4.1.6. Indulgence vs. Restraint</h4>

<p>
A high score on this dimension means the culture generally seeks instant gratification and values immediate fun over following rules or complying with social norms. A low score suggests the opposite.
</p>
<p>
The score for the US is 68, fairly high on the "indulgent" side.
</p>
<p>
<em>Our observation</em>
</p>
<p>
We think this score is too low. Americans are self-indulgent to such a degree as to be self-destructive. This is consistent with other observed characteristics. However, they are also concerned with image - how others see them. They want everything their own way immediately, but they also want to be perceived as respecting tradition and authority, and as behaving according to social norms. 
</p>
<p>
But those social norms do not have deep roots in Americans' minds and hearts. It takes very little to inspire a mob to take to the streets, breaking windows, setting cars on fire, and looting stores; and in response, the authorities often explode into a gleeful orgy of unrestrained violence. 
</p>
<p>
	Americans understand that social norms and formal laws exist, but they do not regulate their own behavior based on these norms and laws. This suggests they do not really care much what the norms or laws are. They are more concerned with immediate gratification.
</p>

<h3>4.2. Loevinger's Stages of Ego Development</h3>

<p>
Jane Loevinger was an American psychologist whose work centered on the development of the ego in individuals. She defined a model of ego development as a "process" that consists of nine consecutive stages of personal growth. Such growth occurs through each person's experience of the world as they mature. Not everyone matures through all nine stages. Certain patterns of behavior are characteristic of people who are at a particular stage.
</p>

<a name="egostages"/>
<h4>4.2.1. Description of Each Stage</h4>

<p>
In a nutshell, the stages are as follows. This is not a comprehensive description. We suggest you look for published material about the model if you want deeper understanding.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Pre-social.</strong> Age: Infancy. Behavior: Cannot differentiate between self and surroundings/caregivers.</li>
		<li><strong>Impulsive.</strong> Age: Young childhood. Behavior: Driven by emotions, reduces everything to "good" or "bad" based on whether a person or thing meets their immediate needs/wants.</li>
		<li><strong>Self-Protective.</strong> Age: Pre-teen childhood. Behavior: Wants a clear set of rules that are always followed. Thinks of the world in terms of reward and punishment. Has the concept of "get what you want but don't get caught."</li>
		<li><strong>Conformist.</strong> Age: Adolescence. Behavior: Awareness of societal expectations, in-groups and out-groups. Wants to belong to an in-group and win their approval.</li>
		<li><strong>Self-Aware.</strong> Age: Late teenage, young adulthood. Per Loevinger, few people move beyond this stage before age 25, and very many adults never do so. Behavior: Aware of differences between their true self and what others expect of them. Can envision multiple outcomes in life events. Can practice self-criticism in a limited way.</li>
		<li><strong>Conscientious.</strong> Age: Adult. Behavior: Remorse for breaking rules gives way to guilt for harming others. Understands the rules of society but recognizes exceptions and special situations. Consideration of other people's motives.</li>
		<li><strong>Individualistic.</strong> Age: Adult. (This is not the same sense of "individualism" as in Hofestede's model.) Behavior: Values own individuality and tolerates that of others. Sensitive to the conflict between outward appearances and inner experiences.</li>
		<li><strong>Autonomous.</strong> Age: Adult. Behavior: Self-fulfillment becomes more important than material gain. Self-acceptance and respect for the autonomy of others. Able to recognize and accept complexity and contradiction. Can assess multiple factors in making moral choices.</li>
		<li><strong>Integrated.</strong> Age: Adult. Behavior: High degree of self-acceptance, empathy for others. Begins to coalesce life experiences and learning into "wisdom." Per Loevinger, very few people achieve this level of ego development.</li>
	</ol>

<h4>4.2.1. Observations of Americans' Behavior</h4>

</p>
<p>
The following summarizes our subjective observations of examples of behavior by Americans seen through the lens of Loevinger's model of ego development. We are concerned with the behavior of adults for purposes of understanding how effectively they may be able to engage with and support a modern political system. We are not considering ego development in children.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aggressive drivers; road rage.</strong>
</p>
<p>
A very common behavior pattern in the present-day US involves car drivers who rush to get ahead of other cars, change lanes or turn without signalling or looking for traffic, tailgate and sometimes flash their headlights or honk their horns, intentionally pass dangerously close to other cars when passing, pass in no-passing sections of the roadway, exceed speed limits (including in school and hospital zones), drive around the gate at railroad crossings to try and beat the train, shake their fists or raise middle their fingers toward other drivers, shout obscenities at other drivers, roll through stop signs, continue through intersections after the traffic light has turned red, turn left in front of oncoming traffic after the traffic light has turned red, and on rare occasions fire guns at other cars, deliberately push another car off the road, or follow another driver to their destination to confront them physically. 
</p>
<p>
Our observation is that this behavior is so common as to be representative of Americans in general. We associate it with level 2 in Loevinger's model, <em>Impulsive</em>. It reflects the desire for immediate gratification of needs or wants without any apparent awareness of potential negative consequences. It is normal in young children. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mob behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>
There are many examples of this category of behavior. They include public protests that spiral out of control, marchers who turn into looters and vandals, police who beat or kill anyone they can find following a public disturbance, groups of people who violate public or private rules to assert their "rights" (e.g., forcing entry into restaurants during the pandemic carrying American flags and not wearing masks). 
</p>
<p>
Our observation is that this behavior is so common as to be representative of Americans in general. We associate it with level 4 in Loevinger's model, <em>Conformist</em>. In particular, it reflects the desire to be part of an in-group. Increasingly extreme behavior tends to result in greater acceptance by an in-group. This behavior is normal in adolescents. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mass response to Donald Trump</strong>
</p>
<p>
Although we are interested in general behavior rather than individuals, the reaction to the rise of Donald Trump in the political sphere is instructive. His speeches at political rallies, his remarks during interviews, his interactions with other world leaders and his constituents, and his comments on social media all reflect behavior associated with level 2, <em>Impulsive</em>. It is the behavior of a small child. Yet, an estimated 74 million Americans have steadfastly supported him since 2016, although as of this writing (2022) a good deal of negative information has emerged regarding his past, his way of thinking, and the real and potential damage he has done to the reputation and economy of the United States, not to mention his role in dividing Americans against each other and inspiring insurrection - behavior that some may characterize as stochastic terrorism.  
</p>
<p>
Our observation is that this reaction on the part of so many Americans is associated with levels 2 through 4 in Loevinger's model. It is the behavior of small children or, at best, adolescents. 
</p>

<strong>General response to human rights abuses</strong>

<p>
When human rights abuses are reported somewhere in the world, Americans usually respond with outrage. News outlets push other stories out of the way and use most of their space to report on the new abuse. But this lasts only a short time. Americans quickly forget about these problems and turn their attention elsewhere - mainly, they turn their attention to whatever feels good to them at the moment.
</p>
<p>
Americans cry out against human rights abuses in China with respect to Tibet, Inner Mongolia, the Uyghur people of Shinjiang Province, and nonconformist groups such as Falun Gong, but only for a short while. Soon, all that news fades into the background for Americans. Americans have responded similarly to human rights abuses in Congo, Sudan, Somalia, Venezuela, and other places. It is as if other humans are literally invisible to Americans, and their lives have no value.
</p>
<p>
If any inconvenience or cost is involved, Americans very quickly turn their backs on the victims of human rights abuse. For example, as a result of sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, retail gasoline prices rose from about $3.50 per gallon to about $5.00 per gallon for Americans; up to about $6.00 in some local markets. Although this price level is lower than that in many countries, Americans have great difficulty sustaining their support for Ukraine when they must pay "extra" for gas. This is nothing less than an elevation of short-term personal convenience over the lives of hundreds of thousands of direct victims of human rights abuses in Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>
Our observation is that this behavior pattern is consistent with levels 2 and 3 in Loevinger's model; <em>Self-Protective</em> and <em>Conformist</em>. It is the behavior of small children.
</p>

<strong>Response to issues of general import</strong>

<p>
The phrase "issues of general import" refers to matters of importance to the nation or society as a whole, and in some cases to the world. These include existential threats like climate change, matters of morality or honor such as gender pay equality, questions of rectifying or mitigating the effects of historical racism, and general short-sightedness about maintaining the physical infrastructure of the country so that we need not pay excessive costs all at once to make thousands of repairs at the same time every few years. 
</p>
<p>
Our observation is that this behavior is so common as to be representative of Americans in general. We associate it with level 2 in Loevinger's model, <em>Impulsive</em>. It reflects the desire for immediate gratification of needs or wants without any apparent awareness of potential negative consequences. It is normal in young children.

<h3>4.3. Avery's Responsibility Process</h3>

<p>
Consultant Christopher Avery observed that people go through a distinct sequence of emotional reactions when something "bad" happens. He developed the Responsibility Process as a way to help us understand this sequence and possibly to improve our ability to take personal responsibility for our own words and deeds. As personal responsibility is a core tenet of American Exceptionalism, it seems reasonable to assess Americans' behavior against this model to see the extent to which they live up to the ideal.
</p>

<a name="#responsibility"/>
<h4>4.3.1. The Process in a Nutshell</h4>

<p>
The premise is that we all go through the same stages, but some people rapidly navigate the initial stages and reach the point that they are genuinely taking responsibilty for their actions. Other people get stuck at an earlier stage and either bail out of the process or live with negative emotions like "shame" for an extended time. The idea is that it is healthier for us to recognize these feelings and put them in proper context than it is to live "automatically" and never know why we are emotionally stuck.
</p>
<p>
When we are faced with the reality that we have harmed someone by word or deed, our first reaction is <em>denial</em>. If we ignore the problem, it will go away. 
</p>
<p>
If we can get beyond denial, the next natural reaction is to <em>lay blame</em>. We want to find a cause for the harm other than ourselves, because it is uncomfortable to think we have harmed someone.
</p>
<p>
If we can get beyond laying blame, we then try to <em>justify</em> what happened. Perhaps it was inevitable, based on the way the world is, or on circumstances beyond anyone's control.
</p>
<p>
The next stage is to lay blame on ourselves, and we experience <em>shame</em>. Avery's model does not distinguish between <em>shame</em> and <em>guilt</em>, but others have done so. They say <em>shame</em> is based on our discomfort with being judged by others, while <em>guilt</em> is an internal emotional reaction in which we truly blame ourselves for the harm we have done. 
</p>
<p>
It is difficult to progress beyond guilt or shame. In Avery's model, people may exit the process at this stage to avoid emotional self-harm. He calls this the <em>quit</em> stage.
</p>
<p>
If we can make ourselves continue, we then advance to <em>obligation</em>. This means we do what we "should" to make things right. Obligation is good, but still doesn't rise to the level of true responsibility.
</p>
<p>
With <em>responsibility</em>, we "own [our] ability and power to create, choose, and attract." It is an acceptance of our role in the harm that was done without "punishment," and the willingness and ability to make things right without feeling "obligated" to do so, in a transactional sense. 
</p>


<a name="#respobservations"/>
<h4>4.3.2. Observations of Americans' Behavior</h4>

<p>
This is an individual model intended for self-reflection and improvement. It doesn't carry over to the level of an entire population. But we can think about how most Americans seem to respond in situations when they need to take personal responsibility.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aggressive drivers; road rage</strong>
</p>
<p>
Aggressive drivers appear to behave at the level of <em>laying blame</em>. "That guy is driving too slow." "Who cares about school zones, anyway?" "He cut me off, so I'm entitled to shoot his family, who are riding in his car."
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mob behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>
People who do "bad things" when part of a mob that they would not ordinarily do as individuals appear to behave at the <em>justify</em> level, and possibly after the fact at the <em>shame</em> level.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mass response to Donald Trump</strong>
</p>
<p>
People who continue to support Donald Trump and the broader Republican agenda after all these years appear to behave at the <em>denial</em> level ("We're not doing wrong, we're doing right!") or the <em>lay blame</em> level ("It's all because of the radical Left!"), or at the <em>justify</em> level ("These steps are necessary to correct problems in the country.").
</p>
<strong>General response to human rights abuses</strong>
<p>
Americans who turn their backs on human rights abuses appear to behave at the <em>denial</em> level ("It's not really happening; I don't see it in my daily life.") or the <em>lay blame</em> level ("It's the fault of the offending government or warlord or cartel; I have nothing to do with it.") or the <em>justify</em> level ("It's the way the world is and there's nothing I can do about it."). 
</p>
<p>
When it comes to human rights abuses by the US government and the American power elite, Americans are institutionally stuck at the <em>denial</em> stage. Public school curricula from the mid-19th century to the present day have systematically and deliberately omitted the "dark side" of US history, emphasized the successes of the wealthy and ignored the plight of the poor, neglected to credit non-white inventors and scientists, and tried to "soften" the message - black slaves appreciated being cared for by their masters, native Americans had no civilization to speak of prior to Europeans' arrival, lynchings were rare and only a few whites participated, it was necessary to separate children from their parents to protect our border, etc. 
</p>
<strong>Response to issues of general import</strong>
<p>
Americans who take no action regarding issues of general import appear to behave at the <em>denial</em> level ("The problem isn't really as bad as they're making it out to be.") or the <em>lay blame</em> level ("I, personally, am not racist, sexist, xenophobic, or homophobic, so it's not my problem; I didn't cause climate change.") or the <em>justify</em> level ("These problems are the result of historical forces over which I have no control."). 
</p>
<p>
People who live in countries that have at least a moderately good material standard of living can take <em>some</em> action in support of human rights. Some Americans have done so - for instance, former US Marine Willy Joseph Cancel, who died in battle in Ukraine as a volunteer. It is disappointing to compare the level of honor and courage he demonstrates with the selfishness and weakness of character so many other Americans exhibit. 
</p>
<p>
Even so, it isn't necessary to make the ultimate sacrifice - one can at least do <em>something</em>, even if it is only to make a small contribution to a charity that provides humanitarian aid (in the case of Ukraine or Congo or Sudan), or that works to deal with climate change, or that provides medical aid to poor countries; or to lend a hand with an organization like Habitat for Humanity, here at home. 
</p>
<p>
People can be inspired by a small gesture. A Belorussian girl named Varya donated her drone to the Ukrainian army. Later, Finnish volunteers delivered 140 drones to the Ukrainian military, and then a Dutch group brought 187 more drones. But it begins with individuals taking personal responsibility. While some Americans rise to the challenge, the majority do not practice personal responsibility in a meaningful way. The behavior is so common that it can be counted as an American trait.
</p>

<a name="commontraits"/>
<h2>5. Common American Traits</h2>

<p>
To craft a system of government that can sustainably serve the needs and wants of a national population would be an easier problem if only the population were homogeneous. The population of America is anything but homogeneous. Many different kinds of people legitimately claim American citizenship and identity, including people whose fundamental values may be vastly different, and in conflict. And yet, any morally defensible, practical, and sustainable form of government for America must accommodate all the different kinds of Americans to the extent practical, or it will be destined to collapse sooner or later.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of what system of government is in place, the people of a diverse nation must accept one another's differences and defend one another's rights if they hope to enjoy independence, prosperity, peace, and freedom. A major challenge facing any new governmental system in America is to heal the divisions between Americans before the people literally kill each other off. 
</p>
<p>
We believe that implies the new system must be based on a clear understanding of what Americans need and how they think and act. While there are many different kinds of Americans, our observations of American behavior suggests there are a few generalization we can make. Of course, not every individual has these characteristics. We are thinking of the population as a whole. If the State is based on wishful thinking or assumptions, it will not last long.
</p>
<p>
Here is our short list of observed characteristics of Americans, intended neither to be critical nor complimentary, but only factual. The State must be organized and operated with these traits in mind, or it will not be sustainable.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Impulsive, self-centered, oblivious to potential consequences, irresponsible, impatient.</li>
		<li>Mentality (or ego development) of a young child, or in the case of "leaders," mentality of a schoolyard bully.</li>
		<li>Need to belong, need approval of in-group members. Need an out-group to focus hate and general frustration with life.</li>
		<li>Worry about finances is a major cause of discontentment and leads to hate and violence.</li>
		<li>Need instant gratification, entertainment, distraction. Boredom quickly leads to crime or to mob behavior.</li>
		<li>Need to feel superior, worthy, entitled, "great." (At the same time: Americans cannot quantify what this means.)</li>
		<li>Majority not interested in education or lifelong learning; most Americans never pick up a book after high school, and are highly susceptible to political propaganda, commercial advertising, and con games.</li>
		<li>No innate respect for "the other." Able to tolerate the existence of "the other" only as long as there is no impact on themselves.</li>
		<li>Not skilled at or interested in critical thinking or systems thinking. Majority prefers an authority figure to tell them what is true and what they should do.</li>
		<li>No interest in the rest of the world. Their universe is America.</li>
		<li>Large proportion of religious Americans want to mix government and religion, and force everyone else to conform with their rules for life.</li>
		<li>Approximately half of Americans are interested in being part of a "country" or "nation," and the other half want to live fully independently (or at least be able to convince themselves they are fully independent), with no duty to anyone else.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of this document, we stated that we want to understand (a) what Americans want and need from their government or their "system," and (b) what sort of government or "system" Americans are capable of operating and sustaining.
</p>
<p>
Regarding question (a), we conclude that any sustainable and practical system must accommodate all the realities listed above. Americans who have different mindsets and different values must be able to live comfortably in the country and all must feel as if they belong. There will be significant challenges in making this happen. Part of the responsibility for this falls to the people themselves - they <em>must</em> break free of the attitude that the entire country has to cater to their personal preferences, and that they are entitled to stomp over other people's rights. The idea of "minding your own business" is a critical success factor.
</p>
<p>
Regarding question (b), it is clear that Americans are not equipped to operate a full-on democracy. That would require a combination of awareness, interest, engagement, education, and critical thinking skills. A sizeable minority of Americans are up to the challenge, but the majority are not. The State must be organized in a way that enables Americans to have a voice in their government while simultaneously protecting them from themselves, so that they will not make disastrous decisions based on ignorance, propaganda, selfishness, hubris, and hatred of "the other."
