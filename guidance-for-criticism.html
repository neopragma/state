<h1>Guidance for Criticism</h1>

<p>
This work is a proposed solution to contemporary problems, and not a request to enter into a debate or discussion. That said, comments and criticism are welcome, as they can help us refine and improve the political model. Those wishing to offer criticism should keep the following points in mind.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Conventional political thinking.</strong> The model is not based on traditional political theories such as communism, socialism, fascism, representative democracy, parliamentary democracy, monarchy, dictatorship, oligarchy, obectivism, libertarianism, anarchy, or theocracy. When you see a provision herein that resembles an approach that might be taken by a follower of one of those traditions, understand that the alignment is almost certainly coincidental. Superficial or accidental alignment with a traditional school of thought does not imply our intent is to implement other tenets of that school of thought. 
	<br/><br/>
	In particular, we reject the "right vs. left" model of political thinking. We consider the knee-jerk reduction of every question to "right vs. left" to be one of the root causes of today's problems. If your impulse is to criticize a provision of the model because it is "too far left" or "too far right," we advise you to consider carefully what you are criticizing, as the concept of "right vs. left" is meaningless to us, and is not the basis of any part of the model. Instead, think about whether the provision in question does or does not support the fundamental principle(s) it is intended to support. That intention will (or <em>should</em>) be documented.</li>
	<li class="linespace"><strong>Conflicting definitions of terms.</strong> Human language is a poor medium of communication. Unfortunately, it is all we have, except in contexts where mathematics or formal logic may be used instead. This is not such a context. We have done our best to define key terms clearly. In some cases, you may have in mind a different working definition of a term than we have. If your impulse is to criticize based on an assumed meaning for a word or phrase, we ask that you consult our <a href="definitions.html">definitions</a> to be sure you are not "barking up the wrong dead horse." 
	<br/><br/>If you say "apple" where we say "orange," then you will not get very far by criticizing our apples because they don't taste like oranges. In case it needs to be said: We are not interested in changing our definitions to align with yours. We prefer to spend our time and energy on matters of greater substance than that. Our definitions may be imperfect, but at least they are internally consistent. To criticize the model, you must first understand it. To understand the model, you must understand the language with which it is described.</li>
	<li class="linespace"><strong>Religious beliefs.</strong> Religious faith is a core part of all human cultures. The majority of individuals belong to an organized religion. Most of those who do not belong to an organized religion still see themselves as spiritual beings, or as creatures that have a spiritual nature in some sense. However, organized religions and extreme religious beliefs have caused most human suffering throughout history. In the US as this is written, religion is one of the root causes of significant social upheaval and is the basis for legislation that conflicts with fundamental human rights. 
	<br/><br/>
	To embrace both those realities - the cultural importance of religious faith to individuals and communities, and the danger to the country of organized religions and large-scale religious movements - our system explicitly separates government from religion. Provided religious practices do not contravene human rights, legal rights, or the Three Pillars, the State has nothing to say about them. The other side of the coin is that religious orders have nothing to say about statutory law or State administrative procedures. That is non-negotiable. If your impulse is to criticize the model because it does not conform with your particular religious beliefs, we advise you to turn your attention to topics about which your criticism might be considered.</li>
	<li class="linespace"><strong>Old wine in a new bottle.</strong> It's a commonplace that there is "nothing new under the sun." Someone, somewhere, has thought of most or all the ideas we considered in creating this political model. If your impulse is to criticize the lack of citations or acknowledgement of original works or people who had similar ideas in the past, you can save yourself some precious time. Where we took ideas from previous work, published or unpublished, we cite that work; an exception is to mention general trends or observations about which you can find numerous references online with very little effort. 
	<br/><br/>
	If we do not cite a source, you can assume we came up with the idea independently, even if it happens to coincide with an idea someone else had in the past. We have not read every word that has ever been written, and we never will. Neither will you. Keep in mind the purpose of this model is to offer a practical solution to real-world problems, and not to produce an academic paper.
