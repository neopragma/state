<h1>Backgrounder on Privacy</h1>

<p>
In the present-day US, intrusions on individual privacy have been increasing steadily for decades. Ostensibly, it is done with good intentions - to identify pedophiles or drug traffickers or domestic abusers or terrorists planning trouble. Privacy is also violated for commercial reasons - mass mailings, telemarketing, text message marketing, and occasionally door-to-door sales, although that is no longer as common as it was in the past. There is also the pervasive monitoring of people's Internet usage, the loading of intrusive software to capture data for marketing algorithms without warning the user, automated monitoring of driving styles in automobiles, and many other examples. 
</p>
<p>
In keeping with our focus on individual liberty, we do not regard Americans as "things" or "targets" to be exploited by commercial interests or by government surveillance. Individual privacy will be an important and respected right under the State system.
</p>
<p>
This view of privacy is consistent with our view on law enforcement. A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Therefore, there is no justification to surveil "just any random person" on the off chance they <em>might</em> do something illegal. This is also the reason our law enforcement processes do not include "policing" the general public - patrolling the streets looking for trouble. 
</p>
<p>
On the commercial side, there is no justification to interrupt people's day to try and foist products and services on them that they did not explicity request, or to comb through their electronic messages to try and identify effective marketing tactics to use with them.
</p>
<p>
People are free to be left alone. They need not respond to a text, answer the door, answer the phone, keep their GPS systems active, or supply marketers with any information whatsoever. Law enforcement needs a warrant based on reasonable cause before entering anyone's home, monitoring their Internet traffic, or tapping their phone. Revealing or exposing anyone's private information will be treated as a crime; it is not covered under freedom of speech.
