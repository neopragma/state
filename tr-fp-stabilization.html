<h1>Transition Plan - Stabilizing the Neighborhood</h1>

<h3>Why stabilize the neighborhood?</h3>

<p>
	It is no great pleasure to live in a fine house that is situated in the middle of a deteriorated and dangerous neighborhood. Maintenance of the house and grounds and ensuring security are more expensive than would be the case were the house located in a stable, prosperous, safe neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
	In keeping with our general approach to foreign policy, we want to avoid enabling hostile foreign powers from establishing bases in territories immediately adjacent to our own. We would consider that an <em>existential threat</em> by definition. The necessity to eliminate existential threats takes precedence over the principle to stay out of other countries' internal affairs.  
</p>
<p>
	This is the reason the State will seek to stabilize the "neighborhood" surrounding America. We are willing to invest heavily in this effort, so that every country in the Americas can be stable, prosperous, and safe. Note we omit the word, "democratic." Per policy, that is none of our business. We need our neighbors to be <em>stable</em>. 
</p>

<h3>Benefits of stabilizing the neighborhood</h3>

<p>
	The benefits of stabilizing the neighborhood touch on several areas of concern. Perhaps most obviously, it would end the flow of refugees and asylum-seekers from Central America. When their home countries are stable and safe, and they can find economic opportunity there without worrying about violence by criminal gangs, people will not be keen to emigrate. 
</p>
<p>
	Secondly, stabilization implies eliminating the criminal cartels that presently engage in trafficking of people, antiquities, drugs, weapons, and so forth. 
</p>
<p>
	Thirdly, stabilization will mean influencing those national governments that are friendly toward hostile foreign powers that can undermine the Three Pillars of Independence if they are permitted to establish a foothold in the Americas. We want to establish America as a highly desirable trade partner and ally.
</p>
<p>
	We believe these three goals are interrelated; addressing any one of them will necessarily mean addressing two or more of them together. For example, unstable regimes provide safe havens for the criminal cartels; the criminal cartels create untenable conditions for ordinary people; ordinary people flee the untenable conditions in their home countries. 
</p>

<h3>International partnerships and cooperation</h3>

<p>
	We cannot accomplish this alone. We must first build positive working relationships with regional governments. Based on those relationships, we must then reach formal agreement with certain regional governments to collaborate closely in the elimination of criminal cartels. This will require time and sustained diplomatic effort. 
</p>
<p>
	Originally, we had anticipated Mexico would be very interested in stabilization, as that country experiences the negative effects of both the criminal cartels and mass migration from Central America, just as the present-day US does - perhaps moreso. But comments by President Obrador in April, 2024, suggest the government of Mexico has been coopted by the criminal cartels at the highest levels. The cartels are now running Mexico directly. This represents an urgent existential threat to America. 
</p>
<p>
	We believe Canada will be willing to cooperate in the stabilization program, particularly in the effort to eliminate the criminal cartels. Canadians suffer from the actions of the cartels.
</p>
<p>
	It may be challenging to reach agreement with the Confederacy due to the inevitable friction that will exist between us in the wake of our "dis-inviting" them from America. Yet, it is in their best interest to solve the regional problems. It will be difficult enough for them to get organized as a separate nation-state without the added threat from the criminal cartels.
</p>
<p>
	Colombia may be another challenge, as their government has come to terms with the cartels and with FARC as a way to halt violence in their country. Their leaders may be too closely entwined with the cartels and FARC for them to shift allegiance without considerable persuasion.
</p>
<p>
	Beyond that, Cuba and Venezuela have evolved into a sort of "axis of brutality" since the Chavez era. Currently, they actively support the cartels in handling drug shipments. It may be necessary to take heavy-handed, direct action to stabilize those countries. However, we will first attempt diplomatic methods. 
</p>
<p>
	When they begin to understand the inevitable outcome of our stabilization program, cartel leaders will seek safe havens in nearby countries. It will be necessary to discourage Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama from offering safe havens. We can use generous economic support to encourage the desired behavior from those governments.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, we must engage with the "good actors" within Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador and help them establish stable governments that have no ties to the criminal cartels. We will also need their assistance to locate and eradicate gang strongholds in those countries, as that is where most of the cartel members come from. 
</p>
<p>
	It is a complicated problem that will involve both logistical challenges in execution and diplomatic challenges in building and maintaining the coalition.
</p>
<p>
	The larger and longer-term stabilization policy involves more than this immediate regional problem. We would like to see every country in the Americas become as strong and successful as possible, given their resources and potential. This will require steady and dependable economic partnership with each country. The State's policies will differ from the historical policies of the US in the region. Our intention is to be a dependable economic partner.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the combined effects of the deterioration of Venezuela since about 1998, the ascendancy of Cuba as a regional influencer since about 2010, and the takeover of the Mexican government by the cartels in the 2020s will make it all but impossible to create a coordinated program with the help of regional governments. We must be prepared - physically and philosophically - to take action we would ordinarily eschew in order to stabilize the region.
