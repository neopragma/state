<h1>Notational Conventions</h1>

<p>
This document explains the page layout, typographical conventions, and spelling/grammatical guidelines used in this collection of material. 
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li class="linespace">Design
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Primary Environment.</strong> The material is meant to be read online using a Web browser. Page design should be basic enough that a printed version of the pages will be legible and contain no displaced or outsized elements.</li>
            	<li><strong>Readability.</strong> Color contrast between background and text, font face, and font size must be reasonable for easy reading. There must be clear distinctions between different elements (headers at multiple levels, body text, emphasis, callouts). Authors may change the particular colors, fonts, and methods of distinguishing elements to improve the readability of the material.</li>
            	<li><strong>Portability.</strong> Use no custom fonts or other elements that are not commonly found on mainstream computer systems and Web browser products. Avoid basing the visual layout of a page on browser-specific features or experimental HTML features.</li>
            	<li><strong>Accessibility.</strong> We require no special actions to support accessibility. By adhering to the principle of simplicity in design, we expect accessibility tools will be able to render the content accurately and without creating issues for the user.</li>
            </ul>
		</li>
		<li>Page Layout
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Breadcrumbs.</strong> The material has a hierarchical structure. At the top of each page, breadcrumbs are displayed showing the path from the index document to the present document. All except the title of the present document are hypertext links that take the reader to the indicated document.</li>
				<li><strong>Version.</strong> After the breadcrumbs and on the same line, the version number of the document is shown in parentheses. The <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> system is used.</li>
				<li><strong>Statement of Purpose.</strong> The purpose of the State is reiterated near the top of each page except the index page, just below the breadcrumb line, in a form that is visually distinct (that is, a callout). The reason to repeat this on every page is to remind both the reader and the authors/maintainers of the material that everything described herein is meant to support that singular purpose. When a reader begins to interpret the material in a different way, they can remind themselves that all the content has the same aim. When an author/maintainer starts to include concepts that do not support the State's purpose, they can remind themselves of that purpose easily.</li>
				<li><strong>Title and Header.</strong> The document title is shown as the HTML document title and as a level 1 header following the statement of purpose.</li>
				<li><strong>Content.</strong> The content of the page comes after the title header and before the license section.</li>
				<li><strong>License.</strong> The license under which the document is published is shown at the bottom of each page, centered.</li>
				<li><strong>Optional elements.</strong> The following conventions may be followed, but they are not required.
					<ul>
						<li>Long pages may have a table of contents.</li>
						<li>Pages containing multiple sections may have numbered subheadings.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Spelling
			<ul>
				<li><strong>American spelling.</strong> Standard American spelling conventions are followed.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Grammar
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Singular "they".</strong> The convention to avoid gender bias is to use the pronoun "they" in the singular sense.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Usage
			<ul>
				<li><strong>May, should/could, must/will, shall.</strong> Certain words carry implications about whether a thing is allowed, possible, or prohibited.
					<ul>
						<li><em>May</em> implies the behavior our outcome described is allowed or permissible under the laws or philosophy of the model.</li>
						<li><em>Should</em> implies the behavior or outcome described is desired or preferable, although it may not be a matter of law.</li>
						<li><em>Could</em> implies the behavior or outcome described is possible. No implication regarding legality or acceptability is intended.</li>
						<li><em>Must</em> or <em>will</em> imply the behavior our outcome described is mandatory under the laws or philosophy of the model. Conversely, <em>must not</em> and <em>will not</em> imply the behavior or outcome described is prohibited under the laws or philosophy of the model.
						<li><em>Shall</em> is not used.
					</ul>
                </li>
 			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Style
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Average educational background.</strong> The style is meant to be accessible by an American adult of typical educational background. There is no requirement to adhere to rigid stylistic rules such as "avoid passive voice" or "avoid dangling prepositions." Colloquial expressions may be used.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-academic tone.</strong> The style is intended to be non-academic, reflecting the practical intent of the model.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
