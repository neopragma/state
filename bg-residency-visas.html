<h2>1. Problems with the Present US System</h2>

<p>
With respect to residency status, the present US system has two issues in particular we want to avoid in the State system:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>No clear status for guest/seasonal workers; and</li>
		<li>Ambiguous and unpredictable treatment of refugees and asylum-seekers.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
With respect to visa types, the present US system defines a large number of different types whose practical effects overlap considerably. Many of these were created to support a specific international agreement. 
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Visitor Visa B</li>
		<li>Visitor Visa B-2</li>
		<li>Student Visa F</li>
		<li>Student Visa M</li>
		<li>Exchange Visitor Visa J</li>
		<li>Immigration Visa</li>
		<li>Temporary Employment Visa H</li>
		<li>Temporary Employment Visa L</li>
		<li>Temporary Employment Visa O</li>
		<li>Temporary Employment Visa P</li>
		<li>Temporary Employment Visa Q</li>
		<li>Media Visa I</li>
		<li>Treaty Trader &amp; Investor Visa E</li>
		<li>NAFTA Professional Worker Visa TN/TD</li>
		<li>Transit Visa C</li>
		<li>Visa Waiver Program (VWP)</li>
		<li>Diplomatic A</li>
		<li>International Employee G</li>
		<li>NATO non-military</li>
		<li>NATO military</li>
		<li>Foreign military stationed in the US - A-2</li>
		<li>Foreign military stationed in the US - NATO</li>
		<li>Religious Worker Visa R</li>
		<li>Crewmember Visa C-1/D</li>
		<li>Exemption for Canadian and Bermudian Citizens</li>
		<li>Special consideration for Taiwan under the One China Policy</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
We believe this system can be simplified considerably.

<h2>2. Residency Statuses and Visa Types</h2>

<p>
In our view, the meaningful differences among residency statuses and corresponding visa types are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Duration of stay</li>
		<li>Option to extend or renew</li>
		<li>Eligibility to work</li>
		<li>Diplomatic status</li>
		<li>Foreign military personnel</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>

<p>
A new visa application or an application to renew or extend a visa may be approved or denied at the discretion of the State. The State may, at its discretion, limit the number of visas of each type that may be in circulation at a given time.
</p>

<a name="visaresident"/>
<h3>2.1. Resident Visa</h3>
<p>
This visa type is for a non-Citizen whose primary place of residence is in America.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Must renew annually;</li>
		<li>Eligible to work, but not in government or law enforcement, and not as a commissioned military officer;</li>
		<li>Can opt in/out of optional income taxes and their associated benefits;</li>
		<li>Cannot vote, petition the government, or serve on a jury.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The State may (or may not) rescind a Resident Visa if the holder is convicted of a crime.
</p>


<a name="visafixed"/>
<h3>2.2. Fixed Term Visa</h3>
<p>
This visa type is for anyone who is in America for a limited time or a specific purpose. This is the most common visa type, and corresponds to many of the different categories defined in present-day US law, including Temporary Employment, Exchange Visitor, Media, Tourist, International Employee, NATO Employee, Religious Worker, and Crewmember. It also covers categories not defined in US law, including refugees, asylum-seekers, guest workers, and seasonal workers.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The term of the stay is set at the time the visa is issued and is based on the purpose of the stay;</li>
		<li>Eligibility to work is set at the time the visa is issued and is based on the purpose of the stay;</li>
		<li>The holder may apply for one extension, in case they are unable to leave America on time for reasons beyond their control;</li>
		<li>The holder does not pay income tax and is not eligible for social benefits except emergency medical care.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The State may rescind a Fixed Term Visa at its discretion.
</p>

<a name="visadiplomatic"/>
<h3>2.3. Diplomatic Visa</h3>
<p>
This visa type is for foreign diplomatic personnel assigned to America by their government. 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Must renew annually;</li>
		<li>No eligibility to work;</li>
		<li>The holder does not pay income tax and is not eligible for social benefits except emergency medical care;</li>
		<li>Diplomatic immunity applies except for <a href="bg-crime.html">Category 1 crimes</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Dependents of diplomatic personnel do not enjoy diplomatic immunity.
</p>
<p>
The State may rescind a Diplomatic Visa at its discretion.
</p>

<a name="visamilitary"/>
<h3>2.4. Military Visa</h3>

<p>
This visa type is for foreign military personnel assigned to America for training, joint exercises, consultation, or as their duty station.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Must renew annually;</li>
		<li>No eligibility to work;</li>
		<li>The holder does not pay income tax and is not eligible for social benefits except emergency medical care.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The State may rescind a Military Visa at its discretion.
</p>

<a name="citizenshippath"/>
<h2>3. Path to Citizenship</h2>

<p>
Anyone of majority age who is in America legally, or who is physically outside America but holds a valid (unexpired) visa, may apply for a Resident Visa. If they are the parents or legal guardians of children or dependents who cannot live independently, those children or dependents are automatically included in such an application.
</p>
<p>
A holder of a Resident Visa who has lived lawfully in America for the time period specified in statutory law may apply for Citizenship.
</p>


<a name="citizenshippath"/>
<h2>4. Unauthorized Presence in America</h2>

<p>
Any person found to be in America without a valid visa is subject to removal from the country. While physically present in America on an unauthorized basis, a person cannot apply for a visa, with the exceptions of
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>requesting refugee status; or</li>
		<li>requesting political asylum; or</li>
		<li>applying for an extension after overstaying a visa, subject to the discretion of a court.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p> A person who has been removed from America due to unauthorized presence must wait one calendar year before applying for legal entry. 
</p>


<a name="criminals"/>
<h2>5. Convicted Criminals</h2>

<p>
Except holders of Resident Visas, a non-Citizen who is convicted of a crime in America loses their visa (if any). If they must serve a sentence in America, then they will be removed from the country immediately on completing said sentence. They must then wait for the longer of (a) one calendar year, or (b) the time specified by the judge in their trial before they can apply for a new visa to enter America. 
</p>
<p>
Holders of Resident Visas who are convicted of crimes are treated much the same as Citizens who are convicted of the same crimes. However, the State may rescind their Resident Visa at its discretion.
</p>


<a name="circumstances"/>
<h2>6. Special Circumstances</h2>

<p>
When unusual circumstances arise that make travel impractical, all visa types will be extended automatically until the situation stabilizes. For example, the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 caused international travel to cease for an unpredictable time. A natural event such as a volcanic eruption or meteor strike, or a man-made disaster such as the outbreak of war, could similarly cause a cessation of travel.
