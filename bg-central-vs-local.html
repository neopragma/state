<h1>Backgrounder on Central Authority vs. Local Autonomy</h1>

<p>
	In discussing our ideas with others, we have noted fundamental misunderstandings we believe arise from two characteristics of the typical American mindset:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Right <em>vs.</em> left political thinking; and</li>
		<li>Binary thinking about authoritarianism <em>vs.</em> democracy, or more generally central authority <em>vs.</em> local autonomy.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	While you may well disagree with our model, it seems rather pointless to disagree with your own misinterpretation of the model. At best it would amount to a waste of your own time and energy. Because such criticism is not actually based on the model under examination, it seems highly unlikely to bear fruit.
</p>

<h3>Not based on conventional Western political thinking</h3>

<p>
	We have not based this model on the conventional Western notion of the political right and left. The fundamental questions from which our reasoning has proceeded are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>How can Americans enjoy the maximum degree of individual liberty possible while preserving the State's ability to assure independence for the country on a sustainable basis?</li>
		<li>Which rights are natural human rights, and what limitations must be placed on individual liberty to ensure no one's human rights are violated?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	There is nothing in these questions that depends on any conventional political model. Some practicalities in realizing these principles may resemble policies common for followers of one or another conventional political philosophy, but any such similarities are coincidental.
</p>
<p>
	What we <em>have</em> discovered is that unencumbered personal liberty for one person necessarily means another person's personal liberty will be infringed. Therefore, in the interest of fairness and sustainability, there must be a balance between individual liberty and civic duty. We have also concluded that when an individual pursues a completely selfish agenda, it is likely they will undermine the State's ability to provide sustainable independence from foreign influences, which in turn may destroy the framework that enables the individual to enjoy personal freedom in the first place. Therefore, the system must be designed to limit the potential damage of such behavior on the part of citizens. 
</p>
<p>
	Apart from those pragmatic and minimal limitations, our system affords greater latitude for individual liberty than the present-day US system. Although the State would have a law enforcement function and a criminal justice system, the general population would not be policed actively, as they are today. People would be free to do as they pleased without interference, unless and until they infringed on someone else's practical ability to live in freedom, at which point they would receive the natural consequences of their own choices - the unavoidable reverse side of the "individual liberty" coin. Criticism of the model on the basis that it reduces individual liberty must, therefore, be based on a misunderstanding of the model and not on its true principles.
</p>
<p>
	Our impression, which we hope is incorrect, is that Americans want to have their cake and eat it, too. They want freedom without responsibility; choices without consequences; public services without engagement in the system; physical defense from external aggression without paying taxes to support it. This is unrealistic.
</p>

<h3>Central authority and local autonomy are not binary choices</h3>

<p>
	Many Americans take the view that a country or government is either 100% authoritarian or 100% democratic, and they conceive of the United States as 100% democratic. Yet, observed reality is that the United States is a blend of authoritarian and democratic elements. We further observe all other countries also blend authoritarianism and democracy in various proportions, and with differing definitions of the two terms. 
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, we consider it reasonable to apply authoritarian policies where they help to assure sustainable independence and freedom, and to apply democratic policies where they do the same. 
</p>
<p>
	In our view, large bureaucracies and centrally-controlled ecnomic systems simply do not work. We agree with the observation of James C. Scott in his book, <em>Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed</em>: "The necessarily simple abstractions of large bureaucratic institutions...can never adequately represent the actual complexity of natural or social processes. The categories that they employ are too coarse, too static, and too stylized to do justice to the world that they purport to describe."
</p>
<p>
	What we have in the present-day US is not one large bureaucratic institution but fifty-one. Perhaps counterintuitively, our plan to eliminate the states and establish a single governmental hierarchy nationwide actually reduces central control and increases local autonomy. We believe the system accomplishes this by providing a general framework of law to hold the country together and assure its independence, and simultaneously avoiding meddling in the details of local and regional affairs. 
</p>
<p>
	Scott quotes a Javanese proverb that captures the essence of this approach: <em>Negara mawi tata, desa mawi cara.</em> "The capital has its order, the village its customs."
</p>
<p>
	Many we have spoken with have insisted the present system of 50 states supports the idea of local autonomy. They resist the elimination of the states because it would wash out the cultural and political differences between them. However, we do not see that there is much difference between any of the states, with the possible exception of Texas. The everyday lives of Americans are approximately the same in every state and under every political party. Americans make much noise about Democrats <em>vs.</em> Republicans or liberals <em>vs.</em> conservatives, but we are hard pressed to find any material difference in quality of life or the general administrative procedures of government from state to state or from Presidential administration to administration over many decades. We therefore see no value in maintaining fifty separate large bureaucracies, each with slightly different laws pertaining to the same matters, each requiring corporations to register separately in every state where they do business, each maintaining its own voter registration rolls and probate laws and insurance regulations and property laws and driver licenses and other things. It is complexity and high cost without any return.
</p>
<p>
	Many Americans who fear a central government would grab too much power at the expense of the states forget that six aspects of the present-day system limit democracy to such a great extent that the voice of the majority is rarely audible at all, let alone authoritative. These are the Electoral College, the two-party system, the lack of proportional representation, the strictly binary selection of candidates, the practice of lobbying, and the process of gerrymandering. These elements of the system have enabled minorities of extremists to take power at the state and federal levels on many occasions throughout the history of the US. How can anyone defend that system in the name of "democracy?" Totalitarianism may be the opposite of democracy, but <em>fake</em> democracy seems qualitatively worse to us, as it is dishonest.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, it has been established that members of a group who participate fully in the group tend to make decisions on behalf of the group that benefit the whole, while those who remain on the periphery and take benefits from the group without being fully engaged tend to make decisions that benefit only themselves, often at the expense of others in the group. This has been demostrated at scale by the voting behavior of the American public. This is the reason our system distinguishes between citizens who are fully engaged with the system and those who, through their own free choice, are not fully engaged. A vote by a fully-engaged citizen carries more weight than a vote by a disengaged citizen. Americans are free to choose to disengage, but not free to avoid the natural consequences of that choice.
