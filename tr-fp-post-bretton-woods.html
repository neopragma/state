<h1>Transition Plan - Post Bretton Woods Defense and Economic Strategy</h1>

<p>
	Toward the end of World War II, the US convened a meeting of over 700 representatives of many countries around the world. Due to the way the war was progressing, most of them arrived at the Bretton Woods, New Hampshire venue expecting the US to dictate terms.
</p>
<p>
	In a sense, they did.
</p>
<p>
	The US opened its market to any and all who had goods to sell, and offered to protect global shipping using the US Navy. In conjunction with various rebuilding initiatives largely funded by the US, such as the Marshall Plan and the reconstruction of Japan, the Bretton Woods system of international trade helped the world recover from the ravages of the war. A longer-term effect was to make it possible for Europeans to begin engaging with each other in a cooperative way, after some five millennia of tribal slaughter.
</p>
<p>
	Today, the balance of power and the shape of international alliances are both very different. Americans see little value to themselves in continuing to support the Bretton Woods system. For their part, the people living in countries where Bretton Woods has enabled peace and prosperity have forgotten how the system affects them. They tend to assume peace and prosperity are the norm, maintained somehow (by magic, perhaps?), and that the US Navy's global sea patrol amounts to American imperialism or hegemony. 
</p>
<p>
	The Bretton Woods system is fading away naturally, and it's being helped along by new international blocs such as BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). BRICS is expanding, and is receiving many more applications for membership than it can handle. And it is only the largest of several emerging international groups that seek economic development and stability on their own terms. 
</p>
<p>
	Americans, too, should seek economic development and stability on their own terms. 
</p>
<p>
	America is one of a few, and perhaps the only country in the world that has the resources to take care of its people's basic needs without hard dependencies on imports. Even as we start to build lasting relationships with other countries - a hard turn from previous US foreign policy - we intend to establish the foundation to support the Three Pillars of Independence with no dependencies on foreign governments. We can't be sure which governments will be friendly or unfriendly from week to week or month to month. 
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, the State will end the Bretton Woods system abruptly and unilaterally, rather than waiting for the other shoe to fall. We understand this will result in temporary instability in some regions, but it is done in the interest of establishing long-term stability globally.
