<h3>1. Real Property</h3>

<p>
	<em>Real property</em> means land, the natural resources on and beneath the land, and artificial improvements or structures attached to the land. The term <em>real</em> is meant to distinguish this type of property from <em>moveable</em> or <em>personal</em> property.
</p>


<a name="history"/>
<h3>1.1. Property Ownership in the Colonies and the United States</h3>
<p>
	The American colonies that would become the United States were founded by the power elite of Great Britain to exploit the natural resources of the New World and to increase the personal wealth of members of a handful of powerful families. The primary way in which the top-tier class of that era maintained power was through ownership of real property - that is, land. The colonial system (and later, the United States) was based in part - in significant part - on John Locke's second treatise of government, published in 1690. This is the treatise in which Locke explains his thinking on the subject of natural law and its relationship with private property.  
</p>
<p>
	Locke's writing is compelling, but also imprecise and subject to interpretation. His ideas were interpreted and applied by the power elite for their own benefit. One of Locke's ideas is that the need for a formal government arises because people living in a natural state cannot protect their property effectively. Therefore, a government was needed whose main purpose was to protect the property rights of those who were privileged to own property already. 
</p>
<p>
	This is, of course, a very high-level summary. Locke's ideas have been debated in great depth for centuries, and it is not our purpose here to reiterate all that. In the context of this backgrounder, the point is that ideas about private property ownership in the United States, and particularly real property, have been elaborated for the benefit of the wealthy few at the expense of the many.
</p>
<p>
	Those in colonial times and in most of US history who owned land had the right to vote. No one else did, until relatively recent times. And so, the laws created by the power elite ensured it would be extremely difficult for anyone not already a member of a leading family to acquire real property. Americans have chipped away at this problem bit by bit ever since. There were still remnants of this system in place as recently as the 1990s, when the state of Arizona still had redlining laws on the books to prevent Native Americans and Blacks from buying property in "white areas." As recently as 2020, the same state passed laws limiting access to polling places in parts of the state that had significant Native populations. For context, Arizona is one of the US states that passed laws as rapidly as possible to strip people of human rights in the immediate post-Trump period. 
</p>
<p>
	Every slave revolt, every labor movement, every left-leaning political party that has ever arisen in US history has been a reaction to the system of elite ownership of land, accompanied by the systematic oppression of everyone who did not own land. Had the oppression not happened, neither would the reactions have happened. Time and again, decade after decade, as the power elite tightened its grip to try and suppress the people, their strategies generated unrest and labor activism - the opposite effect they intended. 
</p>
<p>
	As of 2022, they have still not learned the obvious lesson from this - the harder you squeeze, the less genuine control you have. Eventually the pressure becomes so great that the container cannot hold. It is a lesson the ancient Romans learned well: The key to control is not shackles, enforced poverty, and armed police - it is <a href="bg-bread-circuses.html">bread and circuses</a>, 
</p>



<a name="criticism"/>
<h3>1.2. Historical Criticism of Property Ownership</h3>
<p>
	Historically, two kinds of criticism of private property ownership have been offered: (a) Criticism of the <em>idea</em> of private property ownership, and (b) criticism of the <em>particular system</em> of property ownership that favors a small wealthy elite and tends to hamper other people from acquiring real property.
</p>
<p>
	While we do not subscribe to the "right vs. left" model of political thinking, that model sometimes offers a convenient shorthand way to compare and contrast ideas, provided we keep in mind all political philosophies based on the model are inherently inconsistent and incomplete. As a reaction to the experience of living under the yoke of the power elite, many people in the past few centuries have considered alternative forms for society and government that de-emphasize private property ownership as a way to provide better outcomes to a larger segment of the population. 
</p>
<p>
	These philosophies are usually grouped together under the heading, "leftist." They include everything from socialism to communism to anarchy. It occurs to us none of these ideas would have gained much traction on their own merits (they are academic theories not grounded in observations of human nature or economics in the field), had it not been for the fact the power elite simply squeezed people too hard for too long, until people were ready to try literally <em>anything</em> other than the <em>status quo</em>. Ironically, in their quest to maximize their own wealth, the power elite has expended tremendous sums of money over a period of centuries in the attempt to suppress the rest of the population, when all the while simpler, less-expensive, and more-effective methods were available. All they had to do was relax their grip a little.
</p>
<h4>1.2.1. Anarchist Criticism</h4>
<p>
    Criticism of the idea of private property ownership from "the left" may be summed up by a catch-phrase of the French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in <em>Qu'est-ce que la propriété ? ou Recherche sur le principe du Droit et du Gouvernement</em> (<em>What is Property? Or, an Inquiry Into the Principle of Right and of Government</em>), 1840: <em>"La propriété, c'est le vol!"</em> ("Property is Theft!"). 
</p>
<p>
    We consider this to be an extreme position that offers nothing of practical value for the goal of establishing the conditions under which Americans can live in freedom. We interpret it as a reaction to the power elite's tight control of property rights in that era. It is understandable as an emotional reaction, but it offers no useful guidance toward a better system.
</p>
<h4>1.2.2. Marxist Criticism</h4>
<p>
    The mid-20th-century Canadian political scientist, Crawford Brough MacPherson, offers a slightly more thoughtful critique of private property ownership with his theory of "possessive individualism" (see <em>The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism</em>). An avowed Marxist, MacPherson believed the idea that individuals "own" their skills and owe nothing to society was a deeply-rooted problem in capitalistic countries. He spent many years working out the details of this theory, and undertook deep studies of many other writers, including Locke. Yet, ultimately this body of work seems to us to be another reaction to "the squeeze." He spends many words to describe the problem, but never offers a practical solution.
</p>
<p>
	It seems ironic to us that a Marxist would disparage the idea that individuals "own" their own skills, when the alternative is to grant ownership of people's skills to the very power elite Marxists oppose in principle. Therefore, we interpret this criticism as another reaction to the excesses of the power elite, rather than as a practical solution.
</p>
<h4>1.2.3. Libertarian Criticism</h4>
<p>
	Criticism of the system of the power elite comes from other directions besides "the left." American Libertarians criticize not the idea of private property as such, but the system in which relatively few people have any realistic chance to acquire property. To them, this system is an example of government overreach; the government is essentially controlled by the power elite, who use its power to maintain their own advantage. For Libertarians, the idea of "possessive individualism" is a <em>good</em> thing. But if 50 families own 98% of the property in a country of over 300 million souls, where is the opportunity for individuals to exercise their freedom? Wouldn't it be better if everyone could own a piece of property, however small?
</p>


<a name="observations"/>
<h3>1.3. Observations of Americans' Views on Property Ownership</h3>
<p>
	Through centuries of indoctrination by government, Christian churches, corporate leaders, news media, political propagandists, and the wealthy elite, Americans have been conditioned to believe in the sanctity of private property ownership. Even those who do not own real property and never will, and whose ancestors never owned real property, cling to this belief. 
</p>
<p>
	Even so, the desire for private property is not entirely a result of indoctrination. Sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and city workers who were forced to rent accommodations while being underpaid by the landowners and large corporations developed a keen awareness of the value of owning their own piece of land, where they could always go even if they were fired from their jobs. Therefore, we observe that Americans generally favor the idea of private property ownership, and most would like to own real property themselves. They do not aspire to own the world, as the power elite do; they just want a little something of their own. 
</p>
<h4>1.3.1. Home Buyers</h4>
<p>
    When housing developments are built in the US, the developers want to ensure the property values will remain stable until they have sold all the lots. They don't want people raising cattle in their back yards or repairing tractor-trailer rigs in their driveways while prospective buyers are viewing the house next door. 
</p>
<p>
    To that end, the idea of a homeowners association emerged. These organizations - HOAs - establish rules that the buyers of homes in the development must follow, on pain of having their homes taken from them by force of government. Like any other bureaucracy, once an HOA is established it is almost impossible to get rid of it, even after the lots have been sold and the developer has laughed all the way to the bank. Those who live under the yoke of an HOA are called, cynically, "members."  "Membership" in an HOA is not optional. If you want a house, you must "join." In a sense, people who finally gain the opportunity to own real property do not really "own" the property, although they pay for it. 
</p>
<h4>1.3.2. Renters</h4>
<p>
	Not all Americans are in a position to purchase a house. Most Americans rent. The rental housing market has become dominated by fewer and fewer, larger and larger owners, who jack up rents and force working-class people out in the name of short-term profit for themselves. Americans who have suffered from this situation consider it deeply unfair. A growing segment of the population cannot afford to live in the same city where they work. We see this as one aspect of "the squeeze" that has the potential to <em>cause</em> a general uprising of the people. It is contrary to the national interest to allow the situation to continue.
</p>
<h4>1.3.3. Side-Effects When Civil Servants Cannot Find Affordable Housing</h4>
<p>
	Many of those who cannot afford to live in the same city where they work are police officers. They must risk their lives to protect the people and property of a city that does not consider them worthy to live there. The power elite squeeze those whom they have hired to squeeze everyone else. 
    One is compelled to wonder about the effect on their attitudes toward their work and toward the people they ostensibly serve.
</p>
<p>
	Civil servants do not magically care about the public. We have seen cases when the public is critical of a police action and the police engage in a work slow-down to punish the public for criticizing them by leaving criminals to roam freely. There have been cases of firefighters starting fires and letting them burn, as a way to force approval of labor contracts (this happened in Boston in the late 20th century). 
</p>
<p>
	This happens when police and firefighters are not treated as equal to other people - they aren't paid enough to afford decent housing in the cities where they work, or decent housing is priced artificially high. The power elite likes to call these people "heroes" to pacify them, rather than paying them a decent wage. We believe they would prefer a decent wage. We also believe they would serve the public more effectively if they felt they were part of the community. 
</p>
<h4>1.3.4. Natural Consequences of Arbitrary Rent Increases and Housing Discrimination</h4>
<p>
	From time to time, a poor urban neighborhood erupts into a riot. The people who live there burn everything down and loot the stores. One might wonder why people would destroy their own neighborhood, if they really are angry with someone else who lives in a different part of the city; or indeed where they imagine they will sleep the following night after they have burned down their own homes. The reason is it isn't "their" neighborhood; they don't own their homes. They rent, and the owners jack up the rents arbitrarily. The owners squeeze and squeeze until the container cannot hold. When the container bursts, the power elite blame the ordinary people.
</p>
<p>
	High rents are not the only cause of such riots. The puzzle has many pieces, and the full picture is hard to see until all the pieces are in place. During the 1960s particularly, there were hundreds of large-scale urban riots in which neighborhoods were physically destroyed and people were killed. The National Advisory Committee on Urban Disorders, reporting in 1967, cited "pervasive discrimination in employment, education, and housing" over a period of decades as the general cause of the unrest. 
</p>
<p>
	Sixty years on, nothing has changed on a fundamental level, as the upsurge in racism in the Trump period demonstrates. Hence our position that the true history of the country must be taught in schools, with appropriate context to enable future generations to do something about the real issues - something other than knee-jerk denial of systemic racism, that is. This is a bit of a digression, but not entirely, as fair access to the opportunity to own real property is one aspect of the problem.
</p>
<h4>1.3.5. The "No Property" Movement</h4>
<p>
	There is a movement of people who believe it is neither desirable nor cost-effective for people to own their homes, or even to own personal property. If they need a place to sleep, they can use an apartment that is available for "anyone" to use. While there, if they want to make waffles, they use their smart phone to have a waffle iron delivered to the door. After breakfast, they return the waffle iron to the general pool for someone else to use. If they need to go somewhere, they use a ride or a communal vehicle which they can leave in a designated parking spot near their destination, where someone else can use it later. They don't have to worry about insuring or maintaining anything. They can just float through life using things when they need them.
</p>
<p>
	In our view, the fundamental flaw in this approach is that <em>someone</em> actually owns all these things; the apartment buildings, the cars, the waffle irons, and the rest of it. There are only a handful of owners, and they profit from every action anyone takes; every time someone moves, eats, sleeps, or does anything - or does nothing. The vast majority of people have nothing, and when the system collapses they will be destitute and homeless. The "no property" movement reduces human beings to "things" that consume resources for a fee. 
</p>
<p>
	The system grants unlimited power to large corporate employers, who can destroy a person's life financially by laying them off or firing them: Without cash flow, the individual is literally out on the street with no place to sleep and no means to obtain food or get transportation elsewhere to look for work. It is a system designed and built to enrich the few at the expense of the many.
</p>
<h4>1.3.6. Conclusion</h4>
<p>
	Americans want to own their own homes, and they want to be able to afford a home in a decent neighborhood within a reasonable commuting distance to their jobs. It is not complicated. To make this a reality will be simpler, cheaper, and more effective than any approach to maintaining social order that has ever been attempted in the history of the United States. It is illogical and counterproductive to squeeze the container until it bursts, again and again.
</p>

<a name="ownership"/>
<h3>1.4. Real Property Ownership Under the State System</h3>

<p>
	With fundamental values based on observation of Americans' behavior and consideration of their words, and the goal to craft a system of government with the express purpose of enabling the maximum degree of individual liberty that is sustainable for the majority of Americans, we must recognize that private ownership of real property is one of the core attributes of American culture. We reject the extremes - on the one hand that real property should be owned almost entirely by a small minority of the ultra-wealthy because God has chosen them, and on the other that "property is theft" and no one should personally own anything. 
</p>
<p>
	In attempting to understand human nature so that we could devise a system compatible with human beings, we learned one of the fundamental characteristics of humans is the need to feel as if they have achieved success through their own efforts. That tells us the State should not be in the business of "giving" everything to everyone. Instead, the State's duty is to establish and sustain the conditions under which people have the practical means to achieve success in life, and a reasonable safety net for the times when they stumble. This applies to real property ownership as much as to anything else. 
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, real property ownership will be an opportunity open to all Americans, and various legal safeguards against abuse will ensure that people have a fair chance to purchase real property through their own effort and work. 
</p>
<p>
	In the interest of general quality of life and sustainability of the system, the State will also reserve a percentage of land for public use. This is nothing radical; in the present-day US there are national parks and state parks, and municipalities commonly set aside common areas and parks. 
</p>


<a name="reconciliation"/>
<h3>1.5. Reconciliation of US State Property Laws with American State Law</h3>

<p>
	Under the present-day US system, each US state has defined its own standards, rules, and procedures governing how real property is divided into parcels, what categories of legal use are available, how a parcel may be subdivided or how parcels may be combined, and how parcels may be used ("zoning" and similar laws). Under the State system, the state governments are eliminated in favor of a single governmental hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>
	To change the details of how parcels of land are identified, marked, bought, sold, subdivided, combined, deeded, inherited, and used would be a highly intrusive and disruptive process. Therefore, the State will preserve the rules pertaining to real property within the historical borders of the states. At some point after the completion of the transition period, the government may choose to investigate opportunities to simplify this area of State law. 
</p>
<p>
	Certain provisions of US state law, but not all, may be adjusted by the State immediately, to regularize the law and provide better protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>
	During the transition to the State system, the government will examine state, county, and municipal property laws to see which ones can be regularized easily, without creating economic disruption. The government will also prepare a plan for future changes to standardize these laws to the extent that makes sense for the goals of the State. 
</p>

<h4>1.5.1. Surveys, Measurement, and Identification of Parcels</h4>

<p>
</p>

<h4>1.5.2. Property Laws Pertaining to Married Couples</h4>

<p>
	We observe that present-day US state laws include many provisions under the heading of "property" that pertain to married couples, especially when the marriages break up or when jointly-owned property is sold. For example, in the Delaware State Code, Title 25, Statute 103 deals with "Circumstances under which wife may bar her dower without husband being a proxy." 
</p>
<p>
	The State does not manage "marriage" or "divorce" due to the separation of religion and government. In our view, the language of that Delaware statute is stilted, archaic, and largely meaningless. It harks back to an era when wives were, in effect, the property of their hustbands. American State law can be fundamentally simpler than existing US law in that it need not include any such provisions.
</p>

<h4>1.5.3. Property Owner Associations</h4>

<p>
	Property owner associations, also known as homeowner associations or HOAs, are common in all US states. In most states, they are legally protected, and the purchaser of a home in a development that has a registered HOA is <em>required</em> to "join" the HOA. 
</p>
<p>
	Our observation is the purpose of these laws is to help the property developer maintain a predictable sale price for the individual lots or homes in the development until such time as all the lots or homes have been sold. That makes sense.
</p>
<p>
	After that point, the HOA shifts focus from the developer to the homeowners. However, in almost all cases the HOA provides very little value to the homeowners, and represents (a) another bill to pay, and (b) a source of arbitrary authority that limits how the property owners can use their property. 
</p>
<p>
	Our view is that an HOA provides value to a property developer while they are in the process of selling off all the lots or homes in a new development. The State will allow HOAs for that purpose, but will never require them. 
</p>
<p>
	Once the development has been sold, the HOA will be dissolved. Should the homeowners in a development or neighborhood wish to pool their resources to maintain common areas, they may organize an association to do so. Membership in that association must be <em>voluntary</em>; such membership will never be required by law. Homeowners who elect not to join the HOA will not be subject to its rules.
</p>

<h4>1.5.4. Adverse Possession</h4>

<p>
	The term <em>adverse possession</em> refers to the occupation and improvement of a neglected parcel by a person or persons who act as if they have the legal right to the parcel. Different US states have different rules regarding adverse possession. For example, in the state of Georgia, a person can acquire property by publicly announcing their intention, occupying and using the property exclusively, and paying the property taxes. They have to do this for twenty (20) years to obtain title, and then only if the actual owner fails to step forward to protest the possession. 
</p>
<p>
	Our intention is to leave these laws in place within the borders of the historical US states for the time being.
</p>

<h4>1.5.5. Homestead Laws</h4>

<p>
	Some US states allow homeowners to declare a portion of their real estate holdings their "homestead." This protects the property from foreclosure to pay off creditors. Different states have different rules about what type of dwelling may be declared a homestead, and/or how much acreage can be declared a homestead, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
	Under the State system, it is a violation of human rights to force anyone to live on the street. Therefore, a specific homestead law may not be necessary under State law. Even if we determine a homestead law is necessary, the focus on human rights means that any type of dwelling or structure would qualify. However, it may be reasonable to limit the size or monetary value of the homestead, to prevent abuse of the law. 
</p>

<h4>1.5.6. Common Law</h4>

<p>
	For historical reasons, US state laws are a hodge-podge of case law and common law, and the overall picture is complicated by different state supreme courts and appeals courts deciding similar cases differently. During the transition, and probably for some time after that, the government will review statutes and cases at the state, county, and municipal levels to try and rationalize and standardize laws that are (a) inconsistent across the country, or (b) conflict with the fundamental goal of the State, as reiterated at the top of this page. 
</p>
<p>
	For example, consider the idea of a "spite fence." That is a fence or wall (or any other structure) erected on a property owner's land that obstructs or interferes with a neighbor's ability to use their property, or reduces the value of their property, motivated by "spite" rather than by any constructive purpose. In <em>Cohen v. Perrino</em> (Pennsylvania, 1947), Cohen complained that Perrino had built a 10-foot wall one inch from the east wall of Cohen's house. Perrino built the wall because Cohen's house was built directly on the property line, and two windows on that side of the house overlooked the Perrino back yard. Cohen complained that the wall blocked light and air from his home. The court decided in favor of Perrino, because by Pennsylvania common law the <em>motive</em> for building the wall was immaterial; the fact the wall was entirely on Perrino's property meant he was within his rights to build it.
</p>
<p>
	In a similar case in Georgia, <em>Horsby v. Smith</em> (1941), Smith built an 8-foot solid wooden fence that blocked light and air to Hornsby's home and that served no useful purpose for Smith. The motive to build the fence was to annoy Horsby. The courts decided that while "the owner has a right to use his land for any lawful purpose which violates no right of another person, yet when he uses it maliciously for the sole purpose of injuring another, he thereby invades the rights of such other person and such use is unlawfuland is not supported by any right of the owner."
</p>
<p>
	Under the State system, an offense occurs when harm is done. The definition of harm is broad. The State would not limit decisions to US case law, particularly in situations like this where there are hundreds of cases that have been decided differently, and numerous arguments either way. If Smith harmed Hornsby or Perrino harmed Cohen, then they committed an offense. The right of a property owner to do as they please with their own land is not the question, as far as State law is concerned. In these sample cases, Perrino and Smith exercised their <em>free choice of reckless action</em> to bring harm to Cohen and Hornsby respectively, and they <em>chose</em> the natural consequences of their actions. 
</p>
<p>
	Ultimately, the American State is not the United States. State law is not beholden to US legal precedent any more than it is to Hungarian or Malaysian or Zambian or Ecuadoran legal precedent. 
</p>

<h4>1.5.7. Air Rights</h4>

<p>
	Traditionally, property owners "own" the air above their land to an infinite distance; presumably, to the end of the universe, if the universe has an "end." This is absurd in modern times. Therefore, the State will recognize property owner's air rights to an altitude of 400 meters. The intent is to enable prosecution against those who intrude on that space for purposes of watching or bothering the legitimate users of the land while simplifying flyover rights for aircraft, spacecraft, and satellites. 
</p>
<p>
	Local authorities may establish limits less than 400 meters on the height of structures. For example, in scenic mountainous areas local authorities have set maximum height requirements for structures because blocking the view would have the effect of reducing property values. The maximum height for structures may be lower than the minimum flyover altitude.
</p>

<a name="intellectualproperty"/>
<h3>2. Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>
	<em>Intellectual property</em> (IP) means non-physical products, inventions, creations, and innovations. Examples may include (a) an improved type of toilet, (b) a song, (c) a new medicine to treat schizophrenia, (d) a painting, (e) an innovation in Diesel engine design to save fuel, (f) a novel or short story.
</p>
<p> 
	In the present-day US system, and across the world, IP rights are protected by <em>patents</em>, <em>copyrights</em>, and <em>trademarks</em> or <em>service marks</em>. Confidential information pertaining to competitive advantage in the private sector is also considered a form of IP, even if the information is not formally copyrighted or trademarked.
</p>
<p>
	There are five areas of IP law under the present system:
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
        <li>Patent law, covering tangible inventions;</li>
        <li>Copyright law, covering artistic works and written works;</li>
        <li>Trademark law, covering registered trade marks and service marks;</li>
        <li>Trade secret law, covering methods, formulas, or devices that give a company a competitive advantage in the market; and</li>
        <li>Licensing law, covering terms of use granted by the owner of a protected work.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<a name="ipproblems"/>
<h4>2.1. Problems with the Current System</h4>

<p>
	In our view, the general system of IP law is sound, but certain legal provisions are designed to benefit the power elite (with no effort or creativity on their part) at the expense of the creators of new works, inventions, and innovations. The State would adjust these laws to ensure they are applied equally and fairly to all Americans. 
</p>
<p>
	In the present system, IP law is heavily weighted in favor of large corporations. A corporation can "buy the rights" to your novel, song, or poem. A corporation can price patented medicines out of reach of those who need the treatments. A copyright holder can renew or extend the term of the copyright beyond reason, and others can purchase the copyright to enjoy profits from creative works they did not make.  
</p>
<h5>2.1.1. Example 1: Insulin Pricing</h5>
<p>
	Abuse of patent law is most obvious in the pharmaceutical industry. The inventors of insulin, Frederick Banting, Charles Best, and James Collip sold their patent to the University of Toronto for one dollar in 1923, because they wanted to ensure ready access to insulin by people who needed it. They valued human life above financial gain. But by 2016 the average price per month for diabetes sufferers had risen to $450. As this is written, the US government and a few state governments have taken some (limited) actions to cap co-pays or limit price-gouging, but the problem persists.
</p>
<p>
	In our view, the inability of the federal and state governments in the US to rein in insulin prices boils down to two problems: (1) 50 different state laws and one national law, all inconsistent; and (2) party politicians using insulin prices (and other drug prices) as a political weapon. The first problem overcomplicates every situation, including the question of drug prices and drug access. The second problem is an example of the power elite keeping the people under stress deliberately, as a way to convince them the "other side" is causing their pain so they will support the "right side" politically.
</p>
<p>
	An example of the politicization of the problem is the progress of President Trump's Executive Order No. 13937, published in December 2020, requiring improved access to insulin and epinephrine for low-income patients. This was to have gone into effect on January 22, 2021. President Trump issued a great many Executive Orders, some of which were constructive and some of which were questionable. Following the turmoil of the 2020 elections, the January 6 insurrection, and significant ethical questions about the Trump administration, the Biden administration issued a Regulatory Freeze Pending Review that stopped all the Executive Orders in the pipeline at the time so they could be reviewed for "questions of fact, law, and policy." EO 13937 was caught up in this process, and was never implemented. This led to Republican supporters unleashing a flurry of critical articles and social media posts blaming President Biden (a Democrat) for the high price of insulin.
</p>
<p>
	However, according to a bipartisan investigation of insulin pricing by the US Senate Finance Committee, "pharmaceutical manufacturers have complete control over setting the list price (the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC)) for their products. This investigation found that manufacturers aggressively raised the WAC of their insulin products absent significant advances in the efficacy of the drugs." The investigation discovered several questionable business practices across the pharmaceutical industry that could be considered collusion or price-fixing. Therefore, the political angle on insulin pricing is meaningless; yet, the power elite continues to harp on it for their own purposes.
</p>
<p>
    The State system eliminates both these problems - that of too many conflicting laws, and that of politicization of a matter that should simply be everyday healthcare. There are no states, but only a single government. There are no political parties, and therefore no reason for the powerful to create needless stress for the population to try and convince, coerce, or control them. The focus on human rights and the definition of basic healthcare as a human right, coupled with caps on individual compensation for corporate executives, reduces the incentives to harm or kill people deliberately in order to obtain short-term incremental profit gains.
</p>
<p>
	With respect to the willingness of Americans to believe nonsense, such as the idea that the sitting President personally sets the retail prices of goods in the private sector, such as gasoline or drugs, the State addresses the problem by revamping the public education system. The hope is that by the time Americans reach adulthood, they will have learned how to assess information a little more effectively than that. Unfortunately, the present-day education system in the US does not teach this skill.
</p>

<h5>2.1.2. Example 2: Turing Pharmaceuticals and Daraprim</h5>

<p>
	This example also comes from the pharmaceutical industry, but it illustrates different problems than the first example; namely, (a) patents that never expire, (b) the ability to cause harm to people through arbitrary price increases, and (c) collusion to restrict fair competition. All these things are easy under the present-day US system, even though the last of the three is specifically illegal, and the second may be construed as illegal, or at least unethical. 
</p>
<p>
	The drug <em>pyrimethamine</em> was developed by American scientist Gertrud Elion in 1952, and was released as a treatment for malaria in 1953. Since that time, malaria has evolved resistance to pyimethamine, and it is no longer recommended as a treatment for that infection. However, it continued to be very useful against the parasitic infections toxoplasmosis and cystoisosporiasis. It is also used in conjunction with dapsone to help prevent pneumonia in HIV/AIDS patients. 
</p>
<p>
	Dr. Elion was working for Burroughs-Wellcome in the 1950s, and that firm was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline, which marketed pyrimethamine under the brand name Daraprim. They sold the rights to Daraprim to CorePharma in 2010, and Impax Laboratories bought CorePharma in 2015. They bought the rights in March and sold them again almost immediately, in August of 2015, to Turing Pharmaceuticals. Martin Shkreli, then CEO of Turing, abruptly raised the price of a single dose of Daraprim from $13.50 to $750.
</p>
<p>
	That move alone was sufficient to put thousands of patients at risk of death, but Shkreli did not stop there. Turing colluded with Retrophin, a company formerly headed by Shkreli, to create a "closed" distribution system for Daraprim. Patients could only obtain the drug from a single dispensing pharmacy, Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy, through the so-called Daraprim Direct Program. This set-up was meant to suppress free competition by preventing competitors in the generic drug space from obtaining legal samples of Daraprim for bioequivalence studies, which the FDA requires for approval of a generic drug. 
</p>
<p>
	We see three major problems with that situation. 
</p>
<p>
	First, pyrimethamine was developed about seventy (70) years ago, as this is written. It is proper for the inventors of a thing to enjoy profit from their work for a reasonable time, but it does not seem proper for a patent to be passed from company to company forever, generating unearned profit for people who had nothing to do with the patented item. Is seventy years a reasonable time for a patent to remain in force? And are the original inventors still receiving any benefit from their discovery, or are commercial interests simply riding the wave of their work and collecting profits for work they did not perform? 
</p>
<p>
	This situation would be impossible under the State system. Patents will have a life span of 15 years. They can be bought and sold, but not forever. An inventor can probably think of another invention in 15 years' time. Otherwise, maybe they should consider a different line of work.
</p>
<p>
	Second, we consider healthcare to be a human right, and the State prohibits activity that deprives anyone of a human right. Those who produce and supply pharmaceuticals need to make enough money to stay in business and earn a fair profit, but they must not arbitrarily set prices so high that patients have no alternative but to die. Under the State system, the price hike Shkreli instutited would be prosecuted as attempted mass murder.
</p>
<p>
	Third, the collusion between Turing Pharmaceuticals, Retrophin, and Walgreens to suppress free-market competition would be prosecuted under the State system as undermining the Three Pillars of Independence. Collusion and price-fixing are contrary to the principles of free-market economics, and thus they weaken the national economic system.
</p>
<p>
	In the present-day US system, Shkreli's callous attitude toward the people he harmed, the justice system that tried him, and the journalists who reported on the matter had no material effect on the legal outcome of the case. The only pertinent question is whether the accused violated statutory law. However, under the State system, the offender's attitude toward their victims, the courts, and the society as a whole are taken into consideration when determining fair punishment. Shkreli would have earned the maximum possible sentence for his crimes.
</p>

<h5>2.1.3. Example 3: Hasbro, Inc. v. Clue Computing, Inc. (2000)</h5>

<p>
	Anthony Pratt was a piano player in England who sometimes worked for wealthy customers who hosted murder mystery games in their homes. While providing background music for the games, he made mental notes about the factors that made the games compelling and internally consistent. In the period 1943-1945, during World War II, Pratt developed a miniature version of a murder mystery game as a way to pass the time during air raid blackouts. After a couple of years, Pratt and his wife, Elva, had developed a fairly polished version of the game, which they called Cluedo. In 1947, Pratt patented Cluedo and sold the rights to Waddington, a game manufacturer in England. The rights also went to Waddington's American counterpart, Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers changed the name to Clue for the American market. Hasbro, Inc. purchased Parker Brothers in 1991.
</p>
<p>
	The reason for that capsule history is to underscore the length of time the Clue game has existed, and the role Hasbro, Inc. had in developing it. That is, (1) a very long time, and (2) none whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
	Eric Robison and Dieter Muller were software developers in Colorado who formed a small consulting firm named Clue Consulting in 1994. They presented themselves as consultants who had a clue about how to solve software-related problems. 
</p>
<p>
	You may recall that the World Wide Web had just recently come into existence at that time. Many people perceived the potential value of the web, but no one was quite sure how users would navigate the network or how best to position their products and services on the platform. Hasbro, Inc. owned the rights to quite a few popular board games, and was trying out different ways to present information about them online. They felt URLs like hasbro.com/clue or hasbro.com/battleship or hasbro.com/monopoly would not be as easy for customers to find as URLs like clue.com, battleship.com, or monopoly.com. When they discovered Clue Consulting had registered the domain name, clue.com, they decided they wanted the name.
</p>
<p>
	They informed Network Solutions, the administrators of the domain name, that the name infringed on their trademark, "clue." Network Solutions informed Clue Consulting they would terminate the domain. Clue Consulting sued Network Solutions and won a preliminary injunction against the termination. Hasbro, Inc., responded by suing Clue Consulting in federal district court in Massachussetts, claiming the domain name clue.com diluted their trademark. 
</p>
<p>
	The district court ruled the two businesses were sufficiently distinct that no one would be confused about the meaning of "clue" in either context, and found in favor of Clue Consulting. Hasbro, Inc. appealed, and the US Court of Appeals, First Circuit, affirmed the finding of the district court.
</p>
<p>
	All of that is a matter of public record. Informal information in the software community (which we have not verified) tells a little more of the story. It seems Hasbro, Inc. offered to buy the domain name from Clue Consulting for $10,000. Clue Consulting felt the domain name was important to their business image, and declined the offer. A lot of the ensuing legal friction seems to have stemmed from this refusal. Based on unconfirmed discussion in the software community at the time, the owners of Clue Consulting spent a lot of money trying to defend themselves against Hasbro's lawyers, and their families suffered financially for it.
</p>
<p>
	In the end, the value of the domain name proved to be very low. According to domain.com, a Whois search for the owner of clue.com turns up a Canadian company named Contact Privacy Inc. This appears to be a cover organization whose function is to conceal the identities of domain name owners; or it may be a company that obtains and holds domain names in case someone might want to buy them someday. In any case, Whois also returns the domain names clueproductions.com, cluemusic.com, and flyclue.com, which Hasbro, Inc. apparently does not fear will dilute their trademark. Therefore, Hasbro's behavior is inconsistent at best, unethical at worst, and definitely caused harm. 
</p>
<p>
	What happens when we navigate to URL clue.com? As of 12 July 2022, nothing happens. We could not find a Clue Consulting in Colorado. There is a Clue Consulting registered in Virginia, and the public record states the company is inactive. Hasbro, Inc., does not use URLs like clue.com, monopoly.com, etc.; nor does it use clue.hasbro.com or battleship.hasbro.com, although we did find Monopoly at monopoly.hasbro.com. 
</p>
<p>
	In 1994, no one could have predicted the way users actually search for information online. Yahoo! was founded in 1994, but was not what it is today. AltaVista was founded in 1995, and Google in 1998, <em>after</em> the clue.com dispute. Ultimately, the domain name is not so important; people search for things by keywords, not by guessing URLs.
</p>
<p>
	In hindsight, it might have been better to counter Hasbro's initial offer of $10,000 with, "How about 25?" Twenty-five thousand is an amount most managers in most companies can spend without asking for approval from higher-up. A company the size of Hasbro, Inc., probably has lost more than that amount between the cushions of the sofas in their corporate reception area. The owners of Clue Consulting would have made more money from <em>selling</em> the domain name to Hasbro than they could ever have earned <em>because of</em> the domain name.
</p>
<p>
	This example illustrates two problems with the present-day US system. First, the patent or copyright for the game, Clue, should never have remained in effect for so many years. Hasbro, Inc. did not invent the game, they merely bought the rights to it. In fact, they did even less than that; they bought a company that had previously bought the rights to the game, and that also, in its time, had nothing to do with creating the game. We do not oppose selling IP rights on principle, but we believe an appropriate time limit for patents is 15 years.
</p>
<p>
	Another problem is the way in which Hasbro, Inc. used corporate power and legal leverage to destroy, financially, American families. It is particularly ironic that a company whose products are meant to appeal to children squeezed the Clue Consulting families so hard that they drained their children's college funds in the attempt to defend themselves. Granted, it was not the smartest hill to die on, but even so, a middle-class family cannot match the power of a massive corporation. 
</p>
<p>
	Under the State system, there will be safeguards against this. In particular, there is a law against abusing the system. By that, we mean using legal trickery to force or coerce people to give something up, pay money, or do something. The State follows the principle that the intent of the law trumps the letter of the law; the opposite of the present-day US system. The intent of the law is to uphold justice, not to enable trickery.

<h4>2.2. Intellectual Property Under the State System</h4>
<p>
	Given the criticism of the <em>status quo</em> we have offered so far, it may surprise some readers to learn we do not intend to change much about existing intellectual property law. The main problems are the length of time a patent or copyright remains in effect, and the use of legal trickery to wrest money out of people who had no intention of violating IP rights. 
</p>
<p>
	Some differences:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Patents, cost - it is currently too expensive to file a patent; it can cost upwards of $25,000. This effectively limits patents to large corporations. Individual inventors and innovators must have equal opportunity to file patents <em>in their own name</em> so they cannot be denied their IP rights by an employer. Work done "for hire" is a different matter.</li>
		<li>Patents, duration - it is proper for patent holders to profit from use fees, but it is not appropriate for this to remain in effect indefinitely. The State defines a 15 year lifespan for patents. A patent may be sold or given as a gift, and the recipient can profit from it, but only up to the expiration of the <em>original</em> 15 year period. No renewals.</li>
		<li>Copyrights - the creator of an original work automatically owns the copyright to that work. There is no need to follow any sort of administrative procedure to register a copyright.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
We see little need to revisit trade secrets. The operation of a free market economy requires an "even playing field" for competition. Companies that develop methods, processes, and tools that give them a competitive edge should enjoy the right to keep them confidential. However, we reiterate that the present-day US system is <em>not</em> a free-market economy; it is a controlled economic system that is directed by the power elite for their own benefit. Laws other than those specifically related to IP rights will help correct that problem under the State system.
