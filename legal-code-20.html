</p>

<p>
20. War and the use of military forces.
<br/>
This section of the legal code concerns international conflict and war.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	20.1. Definitions.  
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	20.1.1. International conflict. <em>International conflict</em> is any disagreement, dispute, or friction between the American State and another recognized nation-state. An international conflict does not rise to the level of war.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.1.2. Conflict. <em>Conflict</em> is any disagreement, dispute, or friction between the American State and an organization of any kind that is external to America. A conflict does not rise to the level of war.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.1.3. Insurrection. <em>Insurrection</em> is an attempt or planned attempt to overthrow the Government by force on the part of two or more persons within America or living outside America. Insurrection is the same as any attack on America.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.1.4. War. <em>War</em> is a state of conflict between the American State and any other entity, external or internal, in which hostilities rise to the level of physical, chemical, biological, nuclear, or technology-based attacks and counterattacks, whether direct or asymmetrical. This statute applies to any new capabilities yet to be developed beyond those listed.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.1.5. War response. A <em>war response</em> is the American State's reaction to a serious attack in any form, from any source, in which the full power of the American military and economy is brought to bear against the instigator. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.1.6. Occupation. <em>Occupation</em> refers to the physical presence of American military forces within the territory of another nation-state. 
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.1.7. Prisoner of war. A <em>prisoner of war</em> is an enemy combatant who surrenders or is otherwise captured alive during war. Such a person is held captive until the end of the war in order to deny their services to the enemy.
</p>	
<p class="indent">
	20.2. Initiation and termination of war.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.1. The American State, including its military services, is prohibited from initiating war for purposes of conquest or pillage. War is reserved as a response to aggression.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.2. An aggressive act on the part of any internal or external actor, whether it is the recognized government of a foreign nation-state or any other organization, may elicit a <em>war response</em> at the discretion of the National Council, with the advice of the Military Liaison.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.3. Any form of attack against America may elicit any and all forms of <em>war response</em> against the instigator, at the discretion of the National Council, with the advice of the Military Liaison. There is no requirement for the American State to respond "in kind" to any particular form of attack, or to limit the response to "proportional" actions. The goal is to eliminate the threat to America. Whether that can be achieved with minimal use of force or requires extreme force will depend on circumstances.
</p>		
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.4. <em>Occupation</em> of enemy territory will be limited to the time necessary to consolidate victory and secure an end to fighting. The American State is prohibited from using military occupation as a means to force governmental change in a foreign country.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.5. The American State is not required to assist a defeated enemy to rebuild or recover from damage that results from their initiation of war with America. The National Council is authorized to approve such assistance if it is deemed to be in the interest of America.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.6. American military forces are authorized to accept the surrender of enemy combatants ranging from individuals to the overall armed forces of an enemy.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.7. The National Council is authorized to accept the overall surrender of an enemy country.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.8. The National Council is authorized to consider and accept or reject terms offered by an enemy country to terminate fighting short of their official surrender.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.9. The National Council is authorized to offer terms to an enemy country to terminate fighting short of their official surrender.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.10. American military personnel will not be penalized for surrendering individually or in groups when they find themselves in an untenable situation.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.11. In case of general defeat in war, the overall surrender of the American State to a foreign power is prohibited. The nature of the war may shift into asymmetrical warfare to reclaim American territory lost during conventional combat operations.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.2.12. In case of general defeat in war, foreign occupation of American territory will not be accepted on a permanent basis. The National Council, Military Liaison, and military personnel are authorized to operate in exile and/or on a guerilla basis in order to reestablish the American State.
</p>	


<p class="indent">
	20.3. Rights of enemy combatants and prisoners of war. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.1. All statutes in this section must be consistent with statutes pertaining to human rights. Any statute in this section that violates human rights will not be enforceable. The general exception for individuals who exercise their <em>free choice of reckless action</em> applies. Note: Legal rights as defined in the Legal Code apply to civilians during peacetime. They are distinct from human rights.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.2. Prisoners of war will not be tortured or arbitrarily executed or used for labor, experimentation, or other purposes contrary to fundamental human rights. They will be fed, housed, and treated for medical conditions and injuries at a basic level. They are removed from the fight until the end of the war, but they are not considered criminals.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.3. Prisoners of war who attempt to escape or who engage in uprisings are considered to have re-entered the fight as active combatants. They have exercised their <em>free choice of reckless action</em> and are therefore subject to being killed unless they surrender and return to captivity. American military personnel are prohibited from killing re-captured prisoners of war as retribution for uprisings or attempted escapes.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.4. The Military will conduct its operations in accord with internationally-agreed norms for war except when such norms conflict with any specific statute(s) of the Legal Code. The Legal Code prevails over international law, treaties, and traditional or <em>de facto</em> standards of conduct.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.5. American military personnel are expected to refrain from responding "in kind" to the barbaric behavior they observe or experience from enemy combatants, to the extent a civilized person can reasonably be expected to refrain under such conditions. Investigations of such incidents are required to consider the stress of war as a mitigating factor and to err in favor of the accused American personnel in the absence of compelling and definitive evidence of misbehavior beyond what can be expected of a normal, civilized person who is under extreme stress.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.6. Information about the identity and health status of prisoners of war will be provided to their military command.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.7. Legal Rights statutes in the Legal Code pertain to civilians in peacetime. Procedures for managing enemy combatants and prisoners of war are defined by the Military Liaison, which may delegate such authority to the leadership of the various branches of service.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.8. If an enemy executes or threatens to execute American prisoners of war, the severity of the <em>war response</em> will increase.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.9. Prisoners of war will not be exchanged.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.10. Prisoners of war will be returned to their home countries at the conclusion of the war.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.3.11. Active enemy combatants are considered to have exercised their <em>free choice of reckless action</em> and are subject to being killed without warning and without compensation to their survivors. Note: It is not customary for countries to pay compensation to the survivors of soldiers killed in war. This provision applies to perpetrators of an insurrection who are killed in the response to the insurrection.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    20.3.12. The remains of enemy combatants killed during war with America, and of any prisoners of war who die in captivity, will be returned to their home countries at the conclusion of the war, or at such time afterwards that the remains are discovered and identified.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	20.4. Treatment of civilians during war.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.4.1. Civilians may be encountered in areas that are generally friendly, neutral, or hostile to American forces. When operating in generally friendly or neutral areas, American military personnel are directed to assume most civilians are not dangerous, and to render assistance to evacuate them from active combat areas. Individuals who attack American personnel are considered to have exercised their <em>free choice of reckless action</em>, and may be killed. When operating in general hostile areas, American military personnel are directed to act with caution when interacting with individuals who appear to be civilians. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.4.2. Civilians in war zones are often threatened by different sides in the conflict. They must do as they are told by whomever is holding a gun on them at the moment. American military personnel will not treat civilians who are trapped in this sort of situation as if they are actively withholding information about enemy forces due to malicious intent.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.4.3. Within reason, American military personnel are directed to avoid harming civilians who are in a live combat area. However, the objectives of the mission at hand always take precedence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	20.5. Peacetime uses of military forces.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.5.1. American military personnel and military assets may be enlisted to assist with emergency situations such as power outages, landslides, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, asteroid strikes, outbreaks of disease, and other natural phenomena. 
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.5.2. American military personnel and military assets may be enlisted to assist with crowd control and distribution of aid in areas that have been heavily damaged by natural phenomena or by human actions, and therefore are vulnerable to looting and other misbehavior beyond the capabilities of law enforcement.
</p>	
<p class="indent2">
	20.5.3. American military personnel are not to be used for crowd control in common situations such as public protests, political rallies, and marches. The military is not a general-purpose substitute for civilian law enforcement.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	20.5.4. The National Council, with advice from the Military Liaison, is authorized to approve the use of American military personnel and assets to assist other countries in handling emergency situations.	Such assistance must not result in the appearance of a military occupation, and must not extend beyond a few months even if the situation has not been fully resolved.
