<h1>Law</h1>

<p>
Formal law in the State has a tiered structure, as follows:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="constitution.html">Constitution</a> and addenda thereto</li>
	<li><a href="legal-code.html">Legal Code</a> (statutory law)</li>
	<li>Standards and Regulations set by State agencies</li>
	<li>Rules defined by quasi-governmental citizen bodies at the local and regional levels</li>
</ol>
<p>
In case of conflicts between these legal structures: Standards and Regulations supersede quasi-governmental Rules; the Legal Code supersedes Standards and Regulations; the Constitution supersedes the Legal Code.
</p>

<p>
The Constitution establishes the general legal framework for the State, and the Legal Code defines specific statutes and penalties for violation. It states guiding principles and values for law, but does not specify statutes.Constitutional Addenda provide extended explanations of certain points in the Constitution, and are considered to be at the same level of legal force as the main body of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>
The Legal Code contains statutes. Statutes must be consistent with the values and principles described in the Constitution. Most statutes include specific penalties for violation, or guidelines for setting penalties fairly in cases when judgment is needed. Mechanisms are defined for the people to overturn statutes that violate constitutional principles.
</p>
<p>
The State may define regulations and procedures pertaining to particular activities that may potentially affect the Three Pillars of Independence or interfere with people's human or legal rights. Such rules and procedures have legal force, but less force than statutory law. They are in the nature of operating standards. Examples include fire safety codes, standards for weights and measures, standards for electrical connections, defined limits on environmental damage due to mining or manufacturing, consumer protection from fraud, and similar matters. It is easier to change or overturn regulations and procedures than to change statutory law.
</p>
<p>
As the country is large and diverse, and local needs may vary, the law provides for citizens to form quasi-governmental organizations to establish additional rules and to monitor compliance with those rules. Such organizations may call on the State for support when necessary to maintain order or deal with unusual situations. Conversely, the people may call on the State to help them resist, reorganize, or dissolve such organizations when they act contrary to the needs and interests of the people they are meant to serve.
