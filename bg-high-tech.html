<h1>Backgrounder on Life In a High-Tech World</h1>

<p>
In our view, statutory law should be written in a way that protects people regardless of <em>how</em> illegal actions are performed. One problem with the present-day US system is when technological advances enable new ways to take advantage of people, the existing statutory law does not protect the victims. We subscribe to the principle that a "new" way of committing an offense does not circumvent existing law simply because the old law does not mention the new technology. This is an aspect of the principle that the intent of the law trumps the letter of the law.

The human right to privacy applies regardless of the means by which privacy is violated. Telemarketing, targeted online/phone advertising, collection of mass amounts of information about consumers, and any other method of investigating people or intruding on their lives are all prohibited.

Another example is the idea of the "right to repair," which is currently a topic of debate in the US. In our view, if a consumer purchases a device, they own the device in its entirety, including hardware, software, and any other kind of "ware" that might result from tomorrow's technological advances. If a company wants to retain control over repairs and modificatons to the device and/or its software, they must offer the product on a lease or subscription basis instead of as a sale. Consumers must be informed of the difference so they will understand the terms under which they are obtaining the device. For purposes of the law, the entire product is considered as a unit; for instance, a company cannot sell the hardware and retain ownership of the software, unless any terms different from that are clearly stated prior to the time of purchase.
