<h1>Backgrounder on the Military</h1>

<p>
The present-day US has a well-organized and professional military. The State intends to carry over the existing military to the new system unchanged. The only modifications might be in the insignia and some of the words of oaths of service, to align with the name "America" as opposed to "United States." 
</p>
<p>
The functions of the military include:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Prosecuting declared war against foreign enemies;</li>
		<li>Providing force to support international and/or domestic operations that are threatened by violent opposition;</li>
		<li>Assisting other responders in emergency situations, such as floods and earthquakes;</li>
		<li>Helping maintain order during the transition, as needed. This responsibility ends when the transition is complete.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The shift from a federation of states to a single government means the present state-level National Guard organizations will be subsumed into the national military branches. The professional military will establish standards and perform assessments as they see fit to determine the suitability of current National Guard personnel for service.
</p>
<p>
The State subscribes to two principles with respect to the relationship between the civilian government and the military. 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The military is subordinate to civilian authority.</li>
		<li>The military must be able to act autonomously to a great extent in order to fulfill its mission.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
These principles may, at times, come into conflict with each other. The expectation is that the civilian government will consult with military leaders routinely, through the Military Liaison office, to obtain military perspectives and recommendations and to inform the decision to go to war. Once war is declared, the military leadership will prosecute the war based on their professional judgment and need not request "permission" from the civilian government for any action (short of strategic-level nuclear strikes) they deem appropriate to achieve the objectives.
</p>
<p>
Coordination between civilian and military leadership is handled by the Military Liaison operating unit of the State. This is roughly equivalent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the present-day US system.
</p>
<p>
Military personnel will swear an oath to uphold the Constitution. They are expected to uphold the Constitution even when the civilian leadership becomes corrupt and needs to be corrected or replaced. 
</p>
<p>
The human rights of service members will not be violated. However, some legal rights might be adjusted to conform with military codes. Those who join the military must be informed of this and sign an agreement stating they accept the terms. 
</p>
<p>
Military service is voluntary. Conscription will only be used when circumstances make it unavoidable, and will be temporary.
</p>
<p>
Military leadership are expected to work closely with the Transition Planning, Management and Oversight operating unit of the State during the transition from the US to America.
