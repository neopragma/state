<em>General Provisions; Official Names</em>
</p>

<p>
	1. General Provisions
</p>

<p class="indent">
	1.1. Jurisdiction
	<br/>
    This Legal Code is authoritative within the territorial area of America, and covers Americans living outside that territory.

<p class="indent">
	1.2. Definitions
	<br/>
    Definitions of terms used in the Legal Code.

<p class="indent2">
    1.2.1. Statute 
    <br/>
    A brief statement expressing a single law.    

<p class="indent2">
    1.2.2. Legal Code 
    <br/>
    The official collection of Statutes that defines the law of the land.    

<p class="indent2">
    1.2.3. Statutory Law 
    <br/>
    The level of formal law that stands below the Consitution and above Regulations in relative authority. Statutory Law is defined by the Legal Code.    


<p class="indent">
	1.3. Format of Entries
	<br/>
	This section concerns the structure of the code and the standard format of entries.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.1. Numbering
	<br/>
	Entries in the legal code will be numbered using Arabic numerals in a way that represents a hierarchy of entries, with numerals separated by periods.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.2. Indentation
	<br/>
	An entry subordinate to another entry must be indented with respect to the containing entry.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.3. Topics, Sections, Subsections, and Statutes
	<br/>
	Entries that have a single level number are called <em>Topics</em>. The intent is that they represent a general area of law. Specific statutes are not defined at the topic level.
	<br/><br/>
	Entries that have two level numbers are called <em>Sections</em>. Sections do not stand alone; they are subordinate to Topics. 
	<br/><br/>
	When it is useful to subdivide Sections, subordinate entries may be made that have more than two level numbers. These are called <em>Subsections</em>, except the lowest-level entry. 
	<br/><br/>
	The most detailed entry in any hierarchy under a Topic is called a <em>Statute</em>. 
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">54. Topic Name</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">54.1. Section One</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent5">54.1.1. This is a Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent6">CR: 5.3.4, 7.1</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">54.2. Section Two</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent5">54.2.1. This is a Subsection</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent6">54.2.1.1. This is a Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent7">CR: 4.3</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent6">54.2.1.2. This is a Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent7">CR: 4.4, 5.9.2</span>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.4. Annotations
	<br/>
	This Section defines the <em>annotations</em> that may be present on Statutes.

<p class="indent3">
	1.3.4.1. Constitutional References
	<br/>
	With the exception of entries under <em>General Provisions</em>, each Statute must include one or more <em>Constitutional References</em> to indicate which provisions of the Constitution the Statute supports. Consitutional References are marked CR:. 
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">22.4.8. Text of the Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">CR: 3.2.7, 5.1.

<p class="indent3">
	1.3.4.2. Backgrounder
	<br/>
	The title (and link, when the Legal Code is published in hypertext format) of a Backgrounder that provides clarification and detail about the interpretation of the Statute. The title is preceded by the abbreviation BG:.
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">16.6. Text of the Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">BG: Backgrounder on Education

<p class="indent3">
	1.3.4.3. Transition Rule
	<br/>
	Statutes pertaining to the transitional period when the United States is being shut down and the State is being established will contain the annotation TR: after the level numbers and before the start of the text. Such statutes define exceptions or adjustments to standard law that will be in effect during the transitional period. After the transitional period, these statutes will no longer be relevant.
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">5.7.7 TR: Text of the Statute</span>
</p>

<p class="indent">
	1.4. Use of Language
	<br/>
	This Section concerns the use of language in the Legal Code.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.1. Language
	<br/>
	Statutes will be written in American English as it is commonly used in and around the year 2022 CE.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.2. Common-Sense Understanding
	<br/>
	Statutes are to be interpreted according to their intended meaning to achieve justice, and not interpreted in a stilted or tricky way to win arguments on technicalities. The spirit or intent of the law takes precedence over the letter of the law.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.3. "Will" and "Shall"
	<br/>
	As the words <em>will</em> and <em>shall</em> have equivalent meaning, the word <em>will</em> is to be used. The word <em>shall</em> is considered archaic.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.4. Technical Terms
	<br/>
	Technical words and phrases and those that have acquired a specific meaning in law will be construed according to such meaning.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.5. Ambiguity Due to Tense and Gender
	<br/>
	Present and future tenses are deemed equivalent; singular, plural, and categorical forms are deemed equivalent; and all grammatical genders are deemed equivalent for purposes of interpreting statutes. Minor errors in spelling or grammar will not justify an interpretation of a Statute that violates its intent.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.6. Ambiguity Due to Conditional Language
	<br/>
	The words "could", "ought", and "might", and in some contexts the word "should," are ambiguous and must not be used in statutes.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.7. Intentionally-General Language
	<br/>
	Words and phrases such as <em>may</em>, <em>would</em>, <em>a normal person</em>, <em>reasonable</em>, <em>appropriate</em>, and <em>necessary</em> are used in situations that call for judgment, and a static definition cannot apply to every circumstance. Everyone must make their best effort to interpret Statutes consistently with their intent.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.8. "Can," "May," and "Must"
	<br/>
    The word <em>can</em> implies ability rather than permission, so it will not be used in legal statutes. 
    <br/><br/>
    The word <em>may</em> means "has the option to".
    <br/>
    Example: "If the court rules in favor of plaintiff, plaintiff <em>may</em> seek financial compensation for damages." Plaintiff has the option to seek financial compensation. 
    <br/><br/>
    The word <em>must</em> means "is required to".
    <br/>
    Example: "When either counsel requests information from opposing counsel, opposing counsel <em>must</em> respond in writing within 15 calendar days of the request." Opposing counsel has no option to delay their response beyond 15 days.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.9. Ambiguity Due to Punctuation 
	<br/>
	In a list of items, the Oxford comma will be used to avoid the possibility of interpreting the last two items in the list as being a pair or group that is considered as a single item.
	<br/>
	Example: "Apples, oranges, pears, and lemons are fruits" is a list of four items; "Apples, oranges, pears and lemons" may be interpreted as a list of three items, in which "pears and lemons" together are treated as a single item. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.10. "Everyone" and "Anyone"
	<br/>
	The word <em>everyone</em> refers to all individuals regardless of citizenship, residency, or visa status; and organizations of all kinds. The word <em>anyone</em> refers to the target of an action, be it an individual or a category of people or a group or an organization.
	<br/>
	Example: "Everyone is prohibited from [doing X] to anyone."
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.11. "Free Choice of Reckless Action"
	<br/>
	The phrase <em>free choice of reckless action</em> refers to an individual's choice to take an action that has negative <em>natural consequences</em>. Should others react to the action in a way that harms the original actor, this consideration may legally justify the reaction.
	<br/>
	Example: Killing someone in self-defense. See the <a href="bg-choice.html">Backgrounder on Choices and Consequences</a> for further elaboration of the idea.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    1.4.12. "Written" or "in writing" 
    <br/>
    The word <em>written</em> and the phrase <em>in writing</em> are intended to include electronic methods of communication to which both parties have agreed.    


<p class="indent">
	1.5. Changes to the Legal Code
	<br/>
	This section concerns the procedures to change the legal code.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.1. Proposing a Change
	<br/>
	A change to a legal statute <em>may</em> be proposed in any of the following ways:
	<br/>
	<ul class="indent2">
		<li>Any member of the Decision Making Council <em>may</em> propose a change to the Legal Code. That member <em>must</em> be recused from voting on the change.</li>
		<li>The National Advisory Board, acting as a body, <em>may</em> propose a change to the Legal Code. The Board determines its own internal procedures for agreeing on a proposed change.</li>
		<li>A proposed change <em>may</em> be submitted to the Decision Making Council through a Citizen petition that garners at least one million (1,000,000) signature points.</li>
		<li>The Legal Review Board <em>must</em> request the National Council to consider a change when the Board determines that a Statute violates Constitutional principles.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.2. Considering a Change
	<br/>
	The Decision Making Council <em>must</em> consider and vote on any proposed change to the Legal Code that was presented through a method listed in section 1.5.1 within two (2) months of receipt of the proposal. Repeated failure to meet this schedule may trigger a special election, called by the Legal Review Board on the basis of this Statute, to replace the entire Decision Making Council.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.3. Passing a Change
	<br/>
	A proposal that receives a minimum of twelve (12) votes in favor by the Decision Making Council is considered <em>passed</em>. The change does not have the force of law until it has been finalized <em>per</em> Statute 1.5.8.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.4. Confirming a Change
	<br/>
	The National Advisory Board and the general public have six (6) months to review a change to the legal code that has been passed by the Decision Making Council. If anyone disagrees with the change, they <em>must</em> submit their argument against it within that time through one of the following methods:
	<br/>
	<ul class="indent2">
		<li>Written notification to the Decision Making Council of a 75% majority vote against the change by the National Advisory Board.</li>
		<li>Submission to the Decision Making Council of a citizen petition that garners at least 200,000 signature points.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.5. Reconfirming a Change
	<br/>
	A passed change that was not confirmed must be considered by the Decision Making Council within two (2) months of receipt of written notification of the agreement per section 1.4.4. After reconsidering the change, if the Council makes any adjustments to the proposed change, a new vote must be taken and the same procedures followed as for the first pass through the process. If the Council does not agree on any adjustments, the change is rejected and does not become law. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.6. Discarding a Change
	<br/>
	A change that was rejected by the people or the National Advisory Council, and that was not re-passed with adjustments by the Decision Making Council, is discarded and does not become law. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.7. Limit on Re-Voting
	<br/>
	A change that goes through the process twice without being confirmed or reconfirmed is discarded and does not become law. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.8. Finalizing a Change
	<br/>
	A change that is passed by the Decision Making Council and is not challenged within the period set forth in Statute 1.5.4 is considered <em>finalized</em> and becomes law as of the expiration date of the challenge period. 
</p>


<p class="indent">
	1.6. Abuse of the System
	<br/>
	This section concerns offenses that involve using the legal system as a tool to cause harm to others, or subverting the system through corrupt action.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
   1.6.1. Everyone is prohibited from applying the letter of the law in a way that subverts the intent of the law.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
   1.6.2. Everyone is prohibited using the tort system to cause inconvenience and cost for anyone else when there is no defensible basis for a lawsuit.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
   1.6.3. Offenses that turn the law against the general good are considered to undermine the stability of the system, and therefore are Category 1 offenses.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
   1.6.4. Any government official, employee, or contractor who knowingly accepts money, gifts, or anything of value from any source with the intent to influence their official actions will be considered to have undermined the stability of the system, and therefore guilty of a Category 1 offense.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
   1.6.5. Anyone acting in any role or capacity who offers or gives any government official, employee, or contractor anything of value with the intent to influence their official actions will be considered to have undermined the stability of the system, and therefore guilty of a Category 1 offense.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
   1.6.6. Anyone acting in any role or capacity who threatens or blackmails any government official, employee, or contractor to influence their official actions will be considered to have undermined the stability of the system, and therefore guilty of a Category 1 offense.
</p>
