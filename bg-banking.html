<h1>Backgrounder on the Banking and Financial Services Industry</h1>

<p>
In our view, most of the standards and practices of the financial industry in the US and around the world are the result of many years of discovering what "works" through experience. We are not inclined to discard that experience and the lessons learned from it. 
</p>
<p>
One of the features of the American financial system that allows the economy to be a wealth-generating engine, as opposed to a cog in the international free trade order established at Bretton Woods, is the fact the financial industry operates independently from the government except for necessary regulatory controls to protect Americans from abuse. We do not propose to impose direct government control of the financial industry. That would be a self-defeating strategy.
</p>
<p>
In view of the State's duties to the American people, there are two key areas that require attention:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Protection of the people from fraud and unethical business practices; and</li>
		<li>Managing or limiting the power of international financial institutions that do not see themselves as part of any nation-state</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The former consideration has to do with the State's duty to establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live with freedom. It supports individual liberty. We trust the reader need not be reminded of names like Enron, Worldcom, Wells Fargo, and Countrywide.
</p>
<p>
The latter consideration has to do with the sustainable independence of the country - the Three Pillars of Independence. A company such as JP Morgan Chase, with some 200,000 employees operating in around 150 countries, will become a threat to national security if they adopt the attitude that they are "bigger" than any single nation-state, and owe no loyalty to anyone. The State will come down very hard on this sort of thing. (This is not meant to single out JP Morgan Chase; it is only an example, to indicate the size and extent of business operations we are concerned with.)
