<h1>The Purpose of the State</h1>

<p>
The purpose of the State is to establish and sustain the conditions necessary for the people to enjoy the maximum level of individual liberty without compromising or subverting anyone else's individual liberty, and to do so in a sustainable way.
</p>
<p>
As defined in Section 1 of the <a href="constitution.html">Constitution of the State</a>, this purpose is fulfilled by ensuring the <a href="three-pillars.html">Three Pillars of Independence</a> are maintained over time. The Three Pillars of Independence, in turn, establish the conditions whereby people's <a href="what-are-legal-rights.html">legal rights</a> and <a href="what-are-human-rights.html">human rights</a> are assured, and the people have the practical ability to provide for their <a href="what-are-human-needs.html">human needs</a>.
</p>
<p>
The limitations on the State's power include anything beyond what is necessary to fulfill its defined purpose.
