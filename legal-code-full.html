<h1>Legal Code of America</h1>

<p>
	1. General Provisions
</p>

<p class="indent">
	1.1. Jurisdiction
	<br/>
    This Legal Code is authoritative within the territorial area of America, and covers Americans living outside that territory.

<p class="indent">
	1.2. Definitions
	<br/>
    Definitions of terms used in the Legal Code.

<p class="indent2">
    1.2.1. Statute 
    <br/>
    A brief statement expressing a single law.    

<p class="indent2">
    1.2.2. Legal Code 
    <br/>
    The official collection of Statutes that defines the law of the land.    

<p class="indent2">
    1.2.3. Statutory Law 
    <br/>
    The level of formal law that stands below the Consitution and above Regulations in relative importance. Statutory Law is defined by the Legal Code.    


<p class="indent">
	1.3. Format of Entries
	<br/>
	This section concerns the structure of the code and the standard format of entries.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.1. Numbering
	<br/>
	Entries in the legal code will be numbered using Arabic numerals in a way that represents a hierarchy of entries, with numerals separated by periods.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.2. Indentation
	<br/>
	An entry subordinate to another entry must be indented with respect to the containing entry.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.3. Topics, Sections, Subsections, and Statutes
	<br/>
	Entries that have a single level number are called <em>Topics</em>. The intent is that they represent a general area of law. Specific statutes are not defined at the topic level.
	<br/><br/>
	Entries that have two level numbers are called <em>Sections</em>. Sections do not stand alone; they are subordinate to Topics. 
	<br/><br/>
	When it is useful to subdivide Sections, subordinate entries may be made that have more than two level numbers. These are called <em>Subsections</em>, except the lowest-level entry. 
	<br/><br/>
	The most detailed entry in any hierarchy under a Topic is called a <em>Statute</em>. 
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">54. Topic Name</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">54.1. Section One</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent5">54.1.1. This is a Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent6">CR: 5.3.4, 7.1</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">54.2. Section Two</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent5">54.2.1. This is a Subsection</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent6">54.2.1.1. This is a Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent7">CR: 4.3</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent6">54.2.1.2. This is a Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent7">CR: 4.4, 5.9.2</span>

<p class="indent2">
	1.3.4. Annotations
	<br/>
	This Section defines the <em>annotations</em> that may be present on Statutes.

<p class="indent3">
	1.3.4.1. Constitutional References
	<br/>
	With the exception of entries under <em>General Provisions</em>, each Statute must include one or more <em>Constitutional References</em> to indicate which provisions of the Constitution the Statute supports. Consitutional References are marked CR:. 
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">22.4.8. Text of the Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">CR: 3.2.7, 5.1.

<p class="indent3">
	1.3.4.2. Backgrounder
	<br/>
	The title (and link, when the Legal Code is published in hypertext format) of a Backgrounder that provides clarification and detail about the interpretation of the Statute. The title is preceded by the abbreviation BG:.
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">16.6. Text of the Statute</span>
	<br/>
	<span class="indent4">BG: Backgrounder on Education

<p class="indent3">
	1.3.4.3. Transition Rule
	<br/>
	Statutes pertaining to the transitional period when the United States is being shut down and the State is being established will contain the annotation TR: after the level numbers and before the start of the text. Such statutes define exceptions or adjustments to standard law that will be in effect during the transitional period. After the transitional period, these statutes will no longer be relevant.
	<br/><br/>
	Example:
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">5.7.7 TR: Text of the Statute</span>
</p>

<p class="indent">
	1.4. Use of Language
	<br/>
	This Section concerns the use of language in the Legal Code.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.1. Language
	<br/>
	Statutes will be written in American English as it is commonly used in and around the year 2022 CE.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.2. Common-Sense Understanding
	<br/>
	Statutes are to be interpreted according to their intended meaning to achieve justice, and not interpreted in a stilted or tricky way to win arguments on technicalities. The spirit or intent of the law takes precedence over the letter of the law.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.3. "Will" and "Shall"
	<br/>
	As the words <em>will</em> and <em>shall</em> have equivalent meaning, the word <em>will</em> is to be used. The word <em>shall</em> is considered archaic.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.4. Technical Terms
	<br/>
	Technical words and phrases and those that have acquired a specific meaning in law will be construed according to such meaning.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.5. Ambiguity Due to Tense and Gender
	<br/>
	Present and future tenses are deemed equivalent; singular, plural, and categorical forms are deemed equivalent; and all grammatical genders are deemed equivalent for purposes of interpreting statutes. Minor errors in spelling or grammar will not justify an interpretation of a Statute that violates its intent.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.6. Ambiguity Due to Conditional Language
	<br/>
	The words <em>could</em>, <em>ought</em>, and <em>might</em>, and in some contexts the word "should," are ambiguous and must not be used in statutes.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.7. Intentionally-General Language
	<br/>
	Words and phrases such as <em>may</em>, <em>would</em>, <em>a normal person</em>, <em>reasonable</em>, <em>appropriate</em>, and <em>necessary</em> are used in situations that call for judgment, and a static definition cannot apply to every circumstance. Everyone must make their best effort to interpret Statutes consistently with their intent.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.8. "Can," "May," and "Must"
	<br/>
    The word <em>can</em> implies ability rather than permission, so it will not be used in legal statutes. 
    <br/><br/>
    The word <em>may</em> means "has the option to".
    <br/>
    Example: "If the court rules in favor of plaintiff, plaintiff <em>may</em> seek financial compensation for damages." Plaintiff has the option to seek financial compensation. 
    <br/><br/>
    The word <em>must</em> means "is required to".
    <br/>
    Example: "When either counsel requests information from opposing counsel, opposing counsel <em>must</em> respond in writing within 15 calendar days of the request." Opposing counsel has no option to delay their response beyond 15 days.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.9. Ambiguity Due to Punctuation 
	<br/>
	In a list of items, the Oxford comma will be used to avoid the possibility of interpreting the last two items in the list as being a pair or group that is considered as a single item.
	<br/>
	Example: "Apples, oranges, pears, and lemons are fruits" is a list of four items; "Apples, oranges, pears and lemons" may be interpreted as a list of three items, in which "pears and lemons" together are treated as a single item. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.10. "Everyone" and "Anyone"
	<br/>
	The word <em>everyone</em> refers to all individuals regardless of citizenship, residency, or visa status; and organizations of all kinds. The word <em>anyone</em> refers to the target of an action, be it an individual or a category of people or a group or an organization.
	<br/>
	Example: "Everyone is prohibited from [doing X] to anyone."
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.4.11. "Free Choice of Reckless Action"
	<br/>
	The phrase <em>free choice of reckless action</em> refers to an individual's choice to take an action that has negative <em>natural consequences</em>. Should others react to the action in a way that harms the original actor, this consideration may legally justify the reaction.
	<br/>
	Example: Killing someone in self-defense. See the <a href="bg-choice.html">Backgrounder on Choices and Consequences</a> for further elaboration of the idea.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    1.4.12. "Written" or "in writing" 
    <br/>
    The word <em>written</em> and the phrase <em>in writing</em> are intended to include electronic methods of communication to which both parties have agreed.    


<p class="indent">
	1.5. Changes to the Legal Code
	<br/>
	This section concerns the procedures to change the legal code.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.1. Proposing a Change
	<br/>
	A change to a legal statute <em>may</em> be proposed in any of the following ways:
	<br/>
	<ul class="indent2">
		<li>Any member of the Decision Making Council <em>may</em> propose a change to the Legal Code. That member <em>must</em> be recused from voting on the change.</li>
		<li>The National Advisory Board, acting as a body, <em>may</em> propose a change to the Legal Code. The Board determines its own internal procedures for agreeing on a proposed change.</li>
		<li>A proposed change <em>may</em> be submitted to the Decision Making Council through a Citizen petition that garners at least one million (1,000,000) signature points.</li>
		<li>The Legal Review Board <em>must</em> request the National Council to consider a change when the Board determines that a Statute violates Constitutional principles.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.2. Considering a Change
	<br/>
	The Decision Making Council <em>must</em> consider and vote on any proposed change to the Legal Code that was presented through a method listed in section 1.5.1 within two (2) months of receipt of the proposal. Repeated failure to meet this schedule may trigger a special election, called by the Legal Review Board on the basis of this Statute, to replace the entire Decision Making Council.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.3. Passing a Change
	<br/>
	A proposal that receives a minimum of twelve (12) votes in favor by the Decision Making Council is considered <em>passed</em>. The change does not have the force of law until it has been finalized <em>per</em> Statute 1.5.8.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.4. Confirming a Change
	<br/>
	The National Advisory Board and the general public have six (6) months to review a change to the legal code that has been passed by the Decision Making Council. If anyone disagrees with the change, they <em>must</em> submit their argument against it within that time through one of the following methods:
	<br/>
	<ul class="indent2">
		<li>Written notification to the Decision Making Council of a 75% majority vote against the change by the National Advisory Board.</li>
		<li>Submission to the Decision Making Council of a citizen petition that garners at least 200,000 signature points.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.5. Reconfirming a Change
	<br/>
	A passed change that was not confirmed must be considered by the Decision Making Council within two (2) months of receipt of written notification of the agreement per section 1.4.4. After reconsidering the change, if the Council makes any adjustments to the proposed change, a new vote must be taken and the same procedures followed as for the first pass through the process. If the Council does not agree on any adjustments, the change is rejected and does not become law. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.6. Discarding a Change
	<br/>
	A change that was rejected by the people or the National Advisory Council, and that was not re-passed with adjustments by the Decision Making Council, is discarded and does not become law. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.7. Limit on Re-Voting
	<br/>
	A change that goes through the process twice without being confirmed or reconfirmed is discarded and does not become law. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	1.5.8. Finalizing a Change
	<br/>
	A change that is passed by the Decision Making Council and is not challenged within the period set forth in Statute 1.5.4 is considered <em>finalized</em> and becomes law as of the expiration date of the challenge period. 
</p>

    <br/>
	<span class="indent">BG: <a href="bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a></span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
	3.1. An individual is <em>human</em> and therefore imbued with <em>human rights</em> and entitled to <em>legal rights</em> throughout the lifespan defined in the Constitution.

<p class="indent">
	3.2. Organizations of any kind, including corporations, non-profits, religions, labor unions, clubs, governmental entities, or any other type of organization not listed here, are <em>not</em> considered "human" for purposes of statutory law.

	<br/>
	<span class="indent2">CR: 5.1.4</span>
    <br/>
	<span class="indent2">BG: <a href="bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a>, Section 1.7.1, 1.7.3.</span>

</p>
<p class="indent2">
	3.3.2. When an individual is <em>not</em> capable of upholding their own human rights, the decisions of their healthcare proxy or legal proxy have the same force as if the individual had made the decision under Statute 3.3.1. If no proxy is registered, then the responsibility falls to the nearest living relative who is mentally competent. If no such individual exists or they cannot be found or they explicitly refuse to serve as proxy, then the State will act as proxy.

</p>
<p class="indent2">
	3.3.3. A woman who becomes pregnant and carries the pregnancy successfully to the point that the Constitution defines as the beginning of the human lifespan automatically becomes the healthcare and legal proxy for the unborn child. She remains the default and primary proxy for the child until the child reaches the age of majority. No administrative procedure is required to establish this relationship; however, a different proxy may be assigned should the woman prove to be an unfit parent, or should she choose to surrender this responsibility.

</p>
<p class="indent2">
	3.3.4. Should a pregnancy end unsuccessfully subsequent to the point of viability by a natural process that was not caused by the woman's free choice of reckless action (such as consuming alcohol while pregnant), there is no violation of the human rights of the unborn child, regardless of the stage of development at the point the pregnancy ends. This provision applies to miscarriages and stillbirths.

</p>
<p class="indent4">

</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.2.4. Policing
	<br/>
	This subsection clarifies that <em>policing</em> and <em>law enforcement</em> are not the same. <em>Policing</em> is a method for authorities to monitor and control a population. It usually consists of officers wandering around and looking for trouble. The origins of policing in the US are connected with hunting down runaway slaves in the south and keeping immigrant populations out of white neighborhoods and suppressing organized labor in the cities of the north. In a civilized society, the people do not need to be "policed." We will assume our society is civilized unless and until the people demonstrate a need for stronger controls to ensure public safety.  
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.2.5. Law Enforcement Interaction with Civilians
	<br/>
	Law enforcement personnel are considered to have equal rights with all other Full Citizens. They are not afforded special rights to enable them to violate the law or subvert the human rights or legal rights of others, including suspects.

	Clarifying note: The practice of "civil forfeiture" will be treated as criminal theft.
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: The use of excessive violence, including killing unarmed suspects or suspects who have been brought under control, will be treated the same as if a civilian had exercised the violence. 
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: Law enforcement personnel cannot assert the right to lie to suspects while simultaneously requiring suspects to tell the truth. 
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: The fact an officer "followed procedure" when killing or harming a suspect or bystanders will not excuse the behavior, if a court determines the procedure itself violates human rights or legal rights. An officer's responsibility to uphold human rights and legal rights takes precedence over their obligation to follow prescribed procedures.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.2.6. Civilian Interaction with Law Enforcement
	<br/>
	Civilians are expected to cooperate with law enforcement personnel who are in the process of carrying out their duties, to the extent a normal person would consider reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.2.7. Disciplinary Action

	This section concerns provisions for citizens to handle personal threat situations when conditions do not allow for calling the authorities.  
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.5.1. Personal Weapons
	<br/>
	Citizens are permitted to own and carry such weapons as a normal person would consider appropriate for the purpose of personal self-defense in common threat situations such as mugging, carjacking, home invasion, armed robbery, or acts of similar scope.   
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.5.2. Use of Force
	<br/>
	Citizens are authorized to use such force as a normal person would consider necessary to forestall an act of violence against themselves or others. 
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: This pertains to an immediate physical threat on a personal level, not to an abstract or convoluted rationalization to murder someone for political reasons to "prevent" some possible future act with which the killer disagrees.  
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.5.3. Defense of Property
	<br/>
	Unless an intruder uses or threatens violence as described in section 3.2.5.2, deadly force cannot be used to defend property or to deter or remove trespassers. The value of property does not rise to the level of the value of human life.  
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.2.5.4. Abuse of Self-Defense Rights Is a Crime
	<br/>
	An individual may be charged with a crime if they appear to have contrived an artificial threat situation as a way to commit murder under cover of self-defense.

	<br/>
	An individual is not authorized to exercise their self-defense rights against law enforcement officers who are carrying out their duty to question, detain, or arrest that individual or another individual.

	<br/>
	An individual is not authorized to exercise their self-defense rights against military personnel carrying out their duties pursuant to the State's responsibilities to the nation.

</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.4.4.5. Price Controls
	<br/>
	History has demonstrated that a national economy cannot be managed centrally. Therefore, the State will generally allow the natural operation of supply and demand to determine the price of goods and the cost of labor. However, the State reserves the right to step in should prices or wages be set by a private entity in a way that subverts the human needs, human rights, or legal rights of individuals.

	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: The spirit of the law is that people cannot use business entities as a cover for their own illicit activities, or to shift legal or financial responsibility for harm away from themselves. This statute will be so interpreted in court.  
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.4.4.11. Business Transfer Rule
	<br/>
	A business established in the United States prior to the establishment of the State is considered to continue in existence. There are no formal procedures to continue the operation of the business. Such businesses will register with the State no later than the first day of the tax year following the establishment of the State. Failure to register will incur financial penalties, but no criminal prosecution.

	Clarifying note: The spirit of the law is that the core curriculum represent a minimum set of knowledge and skills necessary for a person to function as an adult member of society, including basic reading, writing, and math skills and the State's responsibilities defined under section 3.3.1 of this code. It is not intended to be an all-encompassing, comprehensive curriculum. The expectation is that educational institutions and home schoolers will supplement the core curriculum with enriched content.

At that time, monies may be transferred to the new accounts. The intent is to avoid creating confusion, logistical problems, or funding problems during the transitional period.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	4.8. Under- and Over-Payment of Taxes
	<br/>
	When the amount of tax paid differs from the amount due, an adjustment will be made for the tax year following the year in which the error was detected. In the event this would create an undue financial burden on the taxpayer, a payment plan will be agreed. The State is not permitted to refuse a taxpayer's request to set up a payment plan.
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: Refunds to taxpayers will not increase the recipients tax liability; they will not be counted as income.   
</p>
<p class="indent">
	4.9. Tax Fraud
	<br/>
	Taxpayers who defraud the State may be enrolled in a payment plan to catch up with missed tax payments. In the event the effects of the fraud cause financial or other loss to people other than the taxpayer who commits the fraud, additional criminal penalties may apply depending on the judgment of the courts.   
</p>
<p class="indent">
	4.10. Tax Audits
	<br/>
	This section concerns audits of tax payments.   
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	4.10.1. State's Right to Audit
	<br/>
	The State may carry out audits of taxpayers, both individuals and corporations, on a random basis to spot-check compliance. The Decision Making Council will establish rules and procedures for tax audits.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	4.10.2. Audit Moratorium
	<br/>
	For a period of five (5) years beginning with the start of the transition from the United States to the State, no individual or corporate tax returns will be subject to audit. 
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: It is expected that there will be confusion and mistakes during the transitional period. The cost of auditing and making corrections is likely to be greater than the value of correcting these mistakes. There will be many other structural and procedural changes to make during the transition that are of higher importance.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	4.11. Tax Account Transfer Rules
	<br/>
	Any tax payments made to the government of the United States or other domestic tax authorities prior to the establishment of the State will be applied toward individual and corporate tax liability to the State. Any monies held by a government agency in excess of an individual's or corporation's tax liability to the State will be refunded in full no later than the end of the first full tax year of State operation. Monies not in excess of an individual's or corporation's tax liability to the State will apply toward payment of such taxes, either in the first full tax year or in partial payments over a series of years, at the taxpayer's option.

</p>
<p class="indent3">

	<br/>
	Out of respect for different philosophical views regarding the proper role of government, everyone is free to opt out of selected parts of the system, including (a) healthcare services, (b) guaranteed minimum income payments, and (c) retirement program. As this choice reduces the individual's investment in the system, the law provides that their voice in government is proportionally reduced, compared with that of a Full Citizen. As the Basic Citizen is not fully invested in the system, they are restricted from working in certain occupations or serving in certain State roles, as they may not have the same dedication to the country as a Full Citizen.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	5.1.2.3. Loss of Full Citizenship Status 
	<br/>
	This subsection defines how a Full Citizen may become a Basic Citizen, and how Full Citizenship can be restored.

There is no limitation on the number of times an individual may opt in or out of any or all optional income tax categories. 
</p>

While their citizenship is revoked, the individual will have no tax liability to the State, will receive no State benefits, and will have no right to vote or sign citizen petitions.
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: This applies to the retirement benefit. Retirement payments will cease when a citizen revokes their State citizenship. Those wishing to retire abroad should consider this before choosing the locale for their retirement, or before deciding to revoke for some other reason. 
</p>
<p class="indent5">

</p>
<p class="indent">
	6.2. Vocational Class
	<br/>
	Everyone who has not completed formal education at least through the Bachelor's degree level, or demonstrated equivalent knowledge, is considered to belong to the vocational class.
</p>
<p class="indent2">

</p>
<p class="indent">
	8.5. Registration
	<br/>
	To ensure household members are able to exercise their rights, a household must be registered with the State.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	8.6. Unregistration
	<br/>
	Households may be unregistered by agreement of its adult members.
</p>
<p class="indent">

</p>
<p class="indent2">

	<br/>
	An adult may join a registered household by following a simple administrative procedure, subject to the limitation defined in section 8.9.
</p>
<p class="indent2">

	A minor who is born into a household or formally adopted by a household becomes a member of that household.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	8.7.3. Minor Changing Household

	<br/>
	Households as recognized by the State are distinct from marriages or family units as recognized by religious orders. 
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: Religious marriages are not automatically recognized as households for legal purposes. To ensure the legal rights of their members, they must register as households. (See sections 8.5 and 8.7). Similarly, withdrawal from a household or unregistration of the household has no effect on the status of a marriage in the eyes of a religious tradition. 
</p>
<p class="indent">
	8.12. Fee Waiver
	<br/>
	The intent of the law is that anyone is able to register with a household and to dissolve such a household easily. The first registration and first unregistration (if any) will be carried out with no fee. Subsequent registrations and unregistrations will incur a minimal processing fee, not to be set so high as to discourage people from using the process. Individuals who join a household or withdraw from a household will be charged a minimal processing fee.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	8.13. Household Transfer Rule
	<br/>
	United States law does not have the concept of a household. People who lived as families prior to the establishment of the State may continue to live together, but they must register as households to get the benefits of State law. The State does not interfere with any adult's choice to live with other people, but such an arrangement provides no special privileges unless it is registered as a household. Minors cannot live separately from a household (see section 8.7.3). Therefore, families that have one or more minor children must register as households within one year of the beginning of State operation. 
</p>
<p>
	9. Minors
	<br/>
	This section concerns adults' responsibilities to uphold the rights of minors.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	9.1. Definitions
	<br/>
	Pursuant to section 2.1 of this code, individuals are entitled to human rights and legal rights from the moment of conception until their affairs are finalized following physical death. A "minor" is defined as anyone who has not reached the age of majority. The "pre-birth" stage of development is the interval between conception and birth. The "childhood" stage is the interval between birth and the age of majority.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	9.2. Rights of Minors
	<br/>
	As minors are not equipped to defend their own rights, all adults living in the jurisdiction of the State are responsible for upholding the human and legal rights of minors. This responsibility falls to all adults, whether citizens or not, whether residents or visitors, whether the adults are part of the same household as the children, and regardless of any special considerations such as diplomatic immunity.  
</p>
<p class="indent">
	9.3. Rights During the Pre-Birth Stage
	<br/>
	The human and legal rights of minors in the pre-birth stage of development are equal to those of any other people. However, they cannot make decisions for themselves. The primary responsibility for decisions affecting the health and well-being of individuals in the pre-birth stage falls to the pregnant woman. 
	<br/><br/>
	The State understands that under certain circumstances, people must make difficult choices, including (a) the decision to abort the pregnancy, or (b) the decision to carry the pregnancy despite health risks to the mother and child, possibly against the advice of doctors. The State will not interfere in such choices. When abortion is decided based on conditions a normal person would consider reasonable, this statute will not create a cause for action against the pregnant woman or anyone in her household or her medical team. Inadvertent termination of the pregnancy in the normal course of events, such as a miscarriage, will not be treated as a criminal act.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	9.4. Rights During the Childhood Stage
	<br/>
	Minors have the same human and legal rights as adults, but lack the capacity to defend their own rights.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	9.4.1. Adult Responsibilities Toward Minors
	<br/>
	Every adult has the obligation to assist and guide minors when they find a minor in a situation that calls for assistance or guidance. Failure to do so is a crime. 
	When an adult intentionally causes harm to or manipulates a minor, the penalties will exceed those for similar crimes carried out against other adults. Failure to report offenses against minors is a crime.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	9.4.2. Adult Offenses Against Minors
	<br/>
	When an adult intentionally causes harm to or manipulates or takes advantage of a minor, the penalties will exceed those for similar crimes carried out against other adults. Failure to report offenses against minors is a crime.

</p>
<p class="indent2">
	9.5.2. Heinous Offenses
	<br/>
	Heinous offenses by minors, such as rape, torture, mutilation, dismemberment, brain damage, loss of physical function, murder, or crimes of similar scope, will be treated the same as if they had been committed by adults. There is no minimum age for offenders in this category.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	9.5.3. Right to Recover Financial Losses
	<br/>
	In the event an offense committed by a minor results in significant financial losses for the victim(s), the victim(s) or their survivors may seek restitution from the household(s) responsible for raising the perpetrators. If the perpetrators were in the care of the State at the time of the offense, then the State may be liable for restoring the victim(s).

	All subsections under 9.6 are subject to the stipulations in this subsection. 
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	9.6.1.1. Background Checks
	<br/>
	All adults involved in a proposed adoption will be subject to criminal and psychological background checks that a normal person would consider appropriate to the purpose. 
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	9.6.1.2. Probationary Period
	<br/>
	Households that adopt minors will be monitored by the relevant State organs to ensure the minors are being treated fairly. The period of time during which the State conducts such monitoring activity is called the "probationary period." The probationary period lasts twelve (12) calendar months from the date the adoption is formally approved. If the responsible adults fail in their duty to the adopted children, the children will be returned to State care.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	9.6.2. Eligibility to Adopt
	<br/>
	This subsection defines who is eligible to adopt children.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	9.6.2.1. Household Eligibility to Adopt
	<br/>
	Any household registered in accordance with section 8 of this code is eligible to adopt minor children.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	9.6.2.2. Individual Eligibility to Adopt
	<br/>
	Any individual adult is eligible to adopt minor children. The adoption process will include registration of the adult and child/children as a household.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	9.6.2.3. Foreign Eligibility to Adopt
	<br/>
	Adults or families resident in countries outside the jurisdiction of the State may apply to adopt minors who are in the care of the State. The probationary period may be waived or adjusted to reflect practical reality, at the discretion of the court.
</p>
<p>
	10. Contracts
	<br/>
	This section concerns contract law.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.1. Legal Contract
	<br/>
	A contract is legally binding when all the following conditions are true:
	<br/>
	<ul class="indent3">
		<li>The contract is written in electronic form or on paper</li>
		<li>All signatories to the contract are of majority age</li>
		<li>The terms of the contract are in compliance with law</li>
		<li>The contract includes language defining how the agreement may be modified</li>
		<li>The contract includes language defining how the agreement may be broken or terminated</li>
		<li>The contract includes language defining how disputes are to be resolved (e.g., arbitration, mitigation, suit, or mutual agreement)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.2. Cooling-Off Period
	<br/>
	Any signatory to a contract may nullify the contract within three (3) calendar days of signing for any reason or for no stated reason.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.3. Performance
	<br/>
	All signatories to a contract will fulfill their obligations under the contract to the best of their ability and will notify the other signatories should they become unable to perform.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	10.4. Unequal Power
	<br/>
	In cases of contract disputes between signatories of vastly unequal wealth and power, the State is required to seek justice in a way that does not result in the financial devastation of individuals.
</p>
<p>
	11. Labor
	<br/>
	This section concerns the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers. The State encourages employers to treat workers fairly on their own initiative, so that excessive legal statutes need not be created to guarantee fair treatment.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.1. Intent of Labor Law
	<br/>
    The spirit of the law is to allow the free market to operate naturally within guardrails to protect the human rights and legal rights of workers and to ensure employers have fair access to labor. 
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.2. Right to Work
	<br/>
	All citizens and all residents within the jurisdiction of the State who have work authorization are free to seek employment without special conditions such as mandatory labor union membership or mandatory use of or membership in employer-owned facilities or organizations. 
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.3. Labor Contracts and Work Agreements
	<br/>
	This section concerns work agreements between employers and workers. Employment is subject to section 3.4.4.6 of this code, providing that the majority of employees in any enterprise operating within the State's jurisdiction must be citizens.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.3.1. Employment Agreements Are Contracts
	<br/>
	An employment agreement is a type of contract and is subject to section 10 of this code.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.3.2. Term of Employment
	<br/>
	An employment agreement may stipulate a specific time period or a time limit for engagement of the employee; or it may be open-ended with respect to time. An employment agreement may specify deliverables or performance of specific tasks rather than time limits.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.3.3. Termination With Cause by the Employer
	<br/>
	An employer may terminate an employment agreement if the employee fails to perform the duties of the job adequately.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.3.4. Termination by the Employee
	<br/>
	An employee may terminate an employment agreement according to the terms of the agreement; e.g., by giving a period of "notice," if the agreement so stipulates.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.3.5. Parties to the Employment Agreement
	<br/>
	The employee may sign an employment agreement on behalf of him/herself or as an agent of his/her own incorporated business entity. 
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: As the State handles healthcare, retirement, and guaranteed minimum income, and income tax rules are the same for all individuals, there is no practical difference between hiring full-time employees, part-time employees, workers through a third-party agency, or independent contractors. This is in contrast to the system of employment in the United States prior to the establishment of the State.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.3.6. Temporary Labor Suppliers
	<br/>
	A business entity may place its employees on temporary assignment to other companies, if that is the nature of its agreements with employees.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.3.7. Employment Transfer Rule
	<br/>
	A business entity whose work force comprises less than the percentage of citizens specified in section 3.4.4.6 of this code will have one calendar year following the establishment of the State to adjust their work force to bring it into compliance. There will be no exceptions due to claims that qualified citizens are not available. This is a correction to the practice in the United States of hiring large numbers of foreign workers, and is considered relevant to the Defense pillar of independence.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.4. Labor Unions
	<br/>
	This section concerns worker organization, work slowdown, work stoppage, and strikes.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.4.1. Worker Organization
	<br/>
	Workers may form organizations to help them assert and defend their rights. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.4.2. Pay Continuance
	<br/>
	Employers must pay striking workers their normal pay rate during strikes. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.4.3. Limitations on Worker Activism
	<br/>
	Workers may strike, stop work, or slow down work individually or through their labor organizations with the following limitations:
	<br/><br/>
	<ul class="indent3">
		<li>Employers may engage temporary replacements for striking workers; workers and labor organizations must not interfere with such workers</li>
		<li>The total time workers strike or stop work cannot exceed eighty (80) hours per year of time that would otherwise have been spent on the job</li>
		<li>No activity of any kind, including worker activism, is permitted to interfere with or subvert the Three Pillars of Independence</li>
	</ul> 
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent3">Violations may result in termination of employment.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.5. Wages and Salaries
	<br/>
	This section concerns compensation for work.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.1. Minimum Wage
	<br/>
	A mandatory minimum wage will be set by the Decision Making Council. The minimum wage will be expressed as an hourly pay rate. For employees who are paid a salary, the minimum annual salary will be ((standard work weeks per year) + (standard paid vacation weeks per year)) x (standard weekly work hours) x (hourly minimum wage).
	<br/><br/>
	Example: If the standard number of work weeks per year is 48 and the standard vacation weeks per year is 4 and the standard number of work hours per week is 32 and the minimum hourly wage is $21.00, then the minimum annual salary is (48 + 4) x 32 x 21 = $34,944.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.2. Categories of Work
	<br/>
	Each employment position will be defined to belong to a particular category of work. The categories will be defined by the Decision Making Council.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.3. Wage and Salary Caps
	<br/>
	Each category of work will have a defined minimum and maximum level of compensation based on a multiplier of the minimum wage. The multipliers will be defined by the Decision Making Council.
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: Cliodynamics studies have found a correlation between out-of-control growth in the rich/poor gap and the decline and fall of civilizations, empires, and nation-states. The purpose of wage and salary caps is to prevent this outcome. Note that in the United States prior to the establishment of the State, some corporate executives received compensation in excess of 1,000 times the average pay of their own employees.
	<br/><br/>
	Example: If the salary cap for executives is 50 times the minimum wage, and we assume the same numbers as in the example under section 11.5.1, then the maximum annual salary for a Chief Executive Officer would be $1,747,200. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.4. Vacation Pay
	<br/>
	Employers must pay full-time hourly workers and salaried workers their normal pay rate for vacation time. The Decision Making Council will determine the standard number of vacation weeks per year. Employers may offer additional paid vacation time as a benefit of employment. Employers need not pay contract workers or temporary "scab" workers vacation time or other benefits.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.5. Taxation of Additional Forms of Compensation
	<br/>
	Employers may offer any benefits for employees they wish as an incentive to attract workers. The following categories will be considered taxable income:
	<br/><br/>
	<ul class="indent3">
		<li>leased or purchased vehicle for personal use</li>
		<li>reimbursement of fuel costs for travel to and from work</li>
		<li>housing allowance in excess of 50% of actual housing costs (includes utilities and services)</li>
	</ul>
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent2">
	Other benefits will not be treated as taxable income unless a normal person would reasonably consider them to be in the nature of "income". Specific cases must be tested in court in response to formal legal challenges.</span>
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="indent2">If offered, the following employer-provided benefits will not be taxable to the employee, and their costs will be deducted from the employer's tax liability:</span>
	<ul class="indent3">
		<li>supplemental healthcare</li>
		<li>childcare services, either on-premises or subsidized</li>
		<li>public transportation passes</li>
		<li>housing allowance up to 50% of actual costs (includes utilities and services)</li>
		<li>hazard pay for dangerous occupations</li>
		<li>parking for personal vehicles at work locations</li>
		<li>employer-provided or employer-paid recreational and fitness facilities</li>
		<li>uniforms and safety gear required for the job</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.6. Day Work
	<br/>
	For purposes of this statute, "day work" means labor performed without a long-term employment contract, such as general labor by workers who are picked up in the morning at a gathering place and taken to a work site.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	11.5.6.1. Day Work Agreement
	<br/>
	Employers must register day workers using an electronic or paper system. They must pay day workers at least the legal minimum wage and report compensation for income tax purposes.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.7. Piece Work
	<br/>
	For some types of work, people prefer to be paid by the quantity of their production. This may be done through a long-term employment agreement or on a day work basis. In either case, employers are responsible for registering workers and tracking their compensation for tax purposes.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	11.5.8. Tips
	<br/>
	The minimum wage system is intended to render obsolete the need for workers in certain occupations to depend on tips. Tipping is optional. Tips are not considered taxable income.
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: The spirit of the law is to help workers in jobs that have traditionally required tips just for survival income. The minimum wage is intended to provide a living wage. Tipping can become an optional "thank you" for good service. The State does not want to penalize this sort of social behavior by taxing it. However, the door is opened for fraud. In cases where "tipping" is used as a cover to pay for illegal activities, the penalties for those illegal activities will be doubled. 
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.6. Working Hours
	<br/>
	A standard number of working hours per week will be defined by the Decision Making Council. Workers engaged for this number of hours will be considered "full time" employees. Individuals may agree to work more hours, or may accept multiple part-time jobs that amount to more hours. 
	<br/><br/>
	Clarifying note: As most benefits are paid for through income taxes rather than by employers, there is little practical difference between a full time and part time employee. The definition of full time serves two purposes: (a) a guideline to help people judge how much work is too much, for their own health, and (b) a baseline for calculating the minimum hourly wage, especially as that number is then used to calculate the minimum annual salary for non-hourly occupations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.7. Worker Safety
	<br/>
	Worker safety regulations will be defined by industry-specific standards organizations. Businesses engaged in activities regulated by such organizations are expected to comply with their regulations. Violations may be civilly and/or criminally prosecuted.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	11.8. Humane Conditions
	<br/>
	Working conditions for all occupations must be such that a normal person would consider them reasonable in context. The State will investigate all alleged violations and take appropriate action, including action against fraudulent reporting of abuses.
</p>
<p>
	12. Due Process of Law
	<br/>
