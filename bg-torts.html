<h2>1. Tort Law in the US</h2>

<p>
	Tort law in the present-day US serves two general purposes:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>It gives individuals a way to fight back against abuse by corporations; and</li>
		<li>It enables individuals to seek compensation and possibly punitive damages from other individuals who have harmed them.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	We observe two critical problems with tort law as practiced in the present-day US:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>People use tort law as a kind of lottery to try and get rich at the expense of their targets, and in many cases simply as a way to force another party to spend money and time dealing with legal paperwork when the accuser knows there is no real harm or no responsibility for harm; and</li>
		<li>Tort law is a hot mess of conflicting state-level laws and federal law, much of which does not support the concept of "justice" as a normal person would understand that concept. The system is not designed to support the two purposes listed above, but instead only serves to enrich lawyers at the expense of ordinary people.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>2. Tort Law in the State</h2>

<p>
	Tort law in the State system serves two purposes:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>It gives individuals and organizations a way to fight back against abuse by any party that has greater power and wealth than themselves; and</li>
		<li>It enables individuals to seek compensation and possibly punitive damages from other individuals who have harmed them.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<a name="intentional"/>
<h3>2.1. Intentional Torts</h3>

<p>
	When someone deliberately causes harm the tort is considered to be <em>intentional</em>. In most cases, the action in question will also be a violation of law, as the State recognizes <em>harm done</em> as the primary indication that an offense has been committed. The reason the matter became visible to the legal system is that someone reported the offense to law enforcement authorities. 
</p>
<p>
	State law already provides for compensation for the victims of offenses, without any need for them to file a lawsuit. Such remedies would be part of the sentence handed down by the court when the offender is convicted. However, if a victim wishes to seek further financial compensation for some reason, they have the right to file suit. We believe a suit for an intentional tort would be unnecessary in nearly every case because of the way State law handles offenses that result in harm.
</p>

<a name="negligence"/>
<h3>2.2. Negligence Torts</h3>

<p>
	When someone fails to take reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent or avoid harm to others, or to post warning signs to inform others that a part of their property is dangerous, in a manner that an ordinary person would expect in the normal course of affairs, the tort is considered to be due to negligence. In these cases, the action may not be a violation of statutory law. If a person harmed by negligent action or inaction wishes to seek financial compensation, they have the right to file suit to recover their costs. Punitive damages do not apply.
</p>

<a name="medical"/>
<h3>2.3. Medical Malpractice</h3>

<p>
	A significant problem in the present-day US system is that medical malpractice is treated as a civil matter. Doctors must purchase expensive malpractice insurance and patients must pay much more for medical services than strictly necessary in order to cover the costs of such insurance. Then the system becomes a "lottery" for people to try and extract large amounts of money from doctors and/or medical institutions.
</p>
<p>
	The State eliminates this problem entirely by defining medical malpractice as a criminal offense, rather than a civil one. There is no such thing as malpractice insurance. This helps control the costs of medical services for patients, and entirely eliminates the possibility of using the tort system as a "lottery." 
</p>
<p>
	The rationale is that if a doctor is in fact incompetent, careless, or malicious, then they should be removed from practice and not be able to buy their way out of trouble. As in any criminal case, the court may include financial compensation for victims in the sentencing phase. Therefore, there is no need for a civil suit on top of the criminal conviction.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to this difference, the professional histories of all medical personnel are open to public scrutiny under the State system. This combination of incentives will keep doctors focused on their work, keep medical costs down, and free up resources in the court system.
</p>


<a name="strictliability"/>
<h3>2.4. Strict Liability Torts</h3>

<p>
	In some legal systems, a person may be held liable for harm even if no crime was committed and they acted with due diligence as an ordinary person would reasonably expect in the normal course of affairs. The example usually given to describe a strict liability tort is the situation when someone's dog bites another person. Under the State's legal system, that kind of situation is not actionable. If the dog's owner failed to comply with local leash laws, and that was the reason the bite was possible, then the case would fall under Statute 15.1.3, a Negligence Tort. The same would be true if the dog were of a breed known to be aggressive, and the owner failed to keep the animal properly contained. But the simple fact that the dog has an owner is not sufficient cause under State law to allow a suit to attempt to extract money from the owner.
</p>
<p>
	That said, recall that the primary way the State recognizes an offense has been committed is by considering whether harm has been done. The nature and extent of the harm may lead to criminal prosecution. Should an animal maul or disfigure or otherwise do significant harm to a person, the animal's owner will be prosecuted criminally. The compensation decreed by the court would be the amount the State considered just in view of the circumstance of the case. Individuals have the legal right to file suit to seek further compensation, but in cases when there is genuinely cause for compensation it is likely the courts would have assessed that compensation in sentencing. Therefore, it is likely suits of this type would be dismissed immediately when a judge reviewed the paperwork.
</p>
<p>
	The concept of <em>free choice of reckless action</em> comes into play, as well. If you see an aggressive dog approaching you on a walk, pay attention. If your neighbor has a swimming pool without a safety fence, keep your children out of their yard and, if there is a local ordinance requiring such a fence, report them to the authorities. 
</p>
<p>
	Under the State system, people have more individual freedom than they had in the US, and that means they also have more personal responsibilty for their own actions. People should not expect to "win the lottery" if they do something foolish or needlessly risky. That is not the purpose of tort law under the State system.
</p>

<a name="comparativenegligence"/>
<h3>2.5. Comparative Negligence</h3>

<p>
	In some cases, both parties share partial blame for the incident that caused harm, or both parties suffered harm in the incident. The prohibition on abusing the legal system for personal ends comes into play here. In a suit, plaintiff may win the full amount they request or part of that amount; defendant may be found responsible or partially responsible for the harm. When both parties are found liable for damages, the judgments will offset each other.
</p>

<a name="abuse"/>
<h3>2.6. Abuse of the System</h3>

<p>
	It is possible the court would find plaintiff had abused the legal system as a way to try and obtain money, not as compensation for the harm but as profit, or to harm the other party in revenge. Under the State's legal system, abusing the law for personal ends is a Category 1 crime. People need the right to sue to recover costs associated with the harm done to them, and possibly to collect punitive damages, as well; but they do not have the right to use the legal system as a "weapon."
</p>
<p>
	Under the present-day US system, when such a case is finally dismissed or a court rules in favor of the defendant, the damage has already been done and the plaintiff who abused the law is not punished in any way. Under the State system, as abuse of the law is a Category 1 crime, the plaintiff may be charged with a criminal offense and risks prison time as well as a financial judgment.
</p>

<a name="statuteoflimitations"/>
<h3>2.7. Statute of Limitations</h3>

<p>
	Some forms of harm are evident immediately. For instance, this would be the case in the majority of automobile collision cases. Even in that kind of case, it is possible a head injury would not manifest diagnosed issues until some time had passed. Other forms of harm, such as exposure to chemicals that cause long term health effects, may not manifest any obvious symptoms of harm for years after the incident in question. 
</p>
<p>
	For "obvious" cases of harm, the harmed party must file suit within two (2) calendar years of the incident. However, to account for cases such as the long-term effects of harmful chemicals, the law will allow for suit to be filed at any time. Courts will determine whether the statute of limitations should be waived on a case-by-case basis.
</p>

<a name="responsibleparties"/>
<h3>2.8. Responsible Parties</h3>

<p>
	The <em>responsible party</em> is the one who must pay any damages arising from the case. There are three aspects of the State system that differ from present-day US law in ways that affect the definition of the responsible parties in a tort case:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Incorporated organizations are not "persons" under the law;</li>
		<li>Incorporated organizations do not constitute a "legal shield" for their owners/leaders; and</li>
		<li>The Government is not exempt from lawsuits when individuals believe they have cause to seek compensation for harm.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	An incorporated organization is likely to have assets in the name of the organization, and its owners/leaders also have personal assets. Some tort judgments will call for damages to be paid in whole or in part from each of these two sources. 
</p>
<p>
	When the Government is the defendant in a tort case, the National Council is treated as the responsible party.
</p>
<p>
	In individual cases, the individual defendant is the responsible party.
</p>

<a name="limitations"/>
<h3>2.9. Limitations on Awards</h3>

<p>
	In some present-day US states, there is no limit to the amount of money plaintiff may seek from defendant. This is one of the aspects of the present-day system that enables people to use tort law as a "weapon" to destroy others and/or to "win the lottery." Under the State system, the purpose of tort law is to enable the victims of harm to be compensated for their costs and, in the case of intentional harm, to receive punitive damages. However, it is not the purpose of tort law (or any other State law) to completely destroy a business enterprise or to throw individuals out of their homes and make them destitute. 
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, for each of the three categories of responsible parties mentioned above, the Legal Code will define limits on compensatory and punitive damages that may be extracted from them in a tort case.
</p>


<a name="courtcosts"/>
<h3>2.10. Court Costs and Attorney Fees</h3>

<p>
	In the present-day US system, it is common for the "loser" in a tort case to pay all the court costs and attorney fees for the "winner." In our view, this is one of the factors that encourages abuse of the system; if you can "win," you not only get a large payback, but you get it without cost to yourself. It also enables those with greater resources, such as large corporations, to pressure individuals to drop cases for fear of losing everything they have in the pursuit of justice.
</p> 
<p>
	Under the State system, should a defendent be found liable for an intentional tort, they will have to pay all costs associated with the case. However, in a negligence tort case, each party is responsible for their own costs, unless in ruling for defendant a court determines that plaintiff had used the tort system as a "weapon;" in that case, plaintiff pays all costs for both sides.
</p>


<a name="primaryresidence"/>
<h3>2.11. Protection of Primary Residence and the Means to Work</h3>

<p>
	A tort case will never deprive anyone of their primary residence or the tools, equipment, and means of transportation necessary for their work. To do so would be a violation of human rights as defined in the Constitution for America.
</p>


<a name="bankruptcy"/>
<h3>2.12. Bankruptcy and Tort Judgments</h3>

<p>
	Judgment for plaintiff for an intentional tort imposes a non-dischargeable debt on defendant. In all other cases, tort judgments are dischargeable debts and cannot be collected in the event defendant subsequently files for bankruptcy.
</p>


<a name="appeal"/>
<h3>2.13. Right of Appeal</h3>

<p>
	When the court rules in favor of plaintiff, defendant will have reasonable rights to appeal the decision. The details are a matter for statutory law.
</p>


<a name="government"/>
<h3>2.14. Government as Plaintiff</h3>

<p>
	The Government is the administrative apparatus of the State, which in turn is the conceptual "collective will of the people." The State and Government are concerned with matters of human rights abuse, legal rights abuse, and the Three Pillars of Independence. Violations of law in those areas are criminal offenses, and not "torts against the State." The idea of a "tort against the State" doesn't quite make sense in our model, and so the idea of the Government as plaintiff in a suit doesn't quite make sense, either.
