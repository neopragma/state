<h1>Transition Plan - Dual-System Stage</h1>

</p>

<p>
	The Dual-System Stage is when we undertake the long, tedious work of converting the details of government operations, law, law enfocement, education, and everything else from the old way to the new way. It is when the Three Pillars of Independence are built.
</p>
<p>
	There are several deeply significant changes that must occur simultaneously during the Dual-System Stage. Some of those that promise to present the largest challenges are:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Institutionalizing the administrative units of the new governmental structure;</li>
		<li>Establishment of the Confederacy and relocation of people to/from the Confederacy based on their preferences;</li>
		<li>Consolidation of law enfocement, criminal investigation, and courts under the single nationwide hierarchy;</li>
		<li>Refocusing of law enforcement activities and retraining of personnel;</li>
		<li>Regularization of state laws regarding real estate, contracts, and other matters into a single, consistent body of law while protecting existing agreements;</li>
		<li>Consolidation of state National Guards under the control of the US military;</li>
		<li>Phase-in of the new national educational system and phase-out of the existing system;</li>
		<li>Establishment of new foreign policy and international agreements;</li>
		<li>Comprehensive review of criminal convictions and adjustment of sentences;</li>
		<li>Establishment of new system of taxation and benefits;</li>
		<li>Establishment of the universal healthcare system;</li>
		<li>Assessment and reorganization of US territories and indigenous areas; and</li>
		<li>Invitation and possible incorporation of additional territories into the American State;</li>
		<li>Divestiture of foreign ownership of land and business interests;</li>
		<li>Registration of households as the family unit for secular legal purposes, due to strict separation of government and religion under the State system; and</li>
		<li>Initiation of the stabilization program for the immediate neighborhood of America.</li>
	</ul>		
</p>
<p>
	The concept is that we will gradually shift from the old to the new administrative structures, formal procedures, and laws in a way that minimizes harmful disruption during the transition. As the saying goes, the devil is in the details. The details are out of scope for this document.
