	3.4.7. Everyone is prohibited from torturing anyone for any reason, including but not limited to punishment for an offense, eliciting a confession, obtaining information, or enjoyment. "Torture" is to be construed as a normal person would ordinarily understand it, and not based on a carefully-crafted definition intended to allow torture under some other name. "Rendition," or moving the object of torture outside the normal operating realm of authorities with the purpose of avoiding prosecution under this Statute (such as the government taking a terror suspect to another country, or a law enforcement agency taking a suspect to an abandoned warehouse) will significantly increase the penalty for this offense.

	3.4.8. Everyone is presumed innocent of a given offense unless and until their guilt is proven in court through standard legal procedures.

<p class="indent3">
	3.4.8.1. Corollary: Consistent with Statutes 3.3.11, 3.3.12, and 3.3.13, a suspect is deemed "innocent" as of the time law enforcement officers may enter their property or home to conduct a search or arrest. Therefore, the State must compensate the individual for property damage and for theft that was enabled by the officers' damaging normal security facilities such as door locks and gates. Even if the suspect is ultimately convicted, they were "innocent" as of the time of the search.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.4.8.2. Corollary: The practice of "bail," or charging a fee for the release of a suspect awaiting trial, is considered a form of corruption. Either the authorities can support the claim that the suspect is a danger to the public or they cannot. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	3.4.9. Everyone charged with an offense has the right to timely adjudication of their case. The first hearing or the trial must be conducted within two (2) months of the date charges were brought. If no hearing or trial has been conducted by this time, the suspect must be released, if they are being held to await trial. The first hearing or trial must then take place within four (4) months of the expiration of the first waiting period. If after that time, no hearing or trial has been conducted, the charges are automatically dropped.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	For all Category 1 offenses and for Category 2 offenses in which the damage exceeds $5,000 in value, the accused is entitled to a trial by jury. For all other offenses, the accused has the right to demand a trial by jury. Such demand cannot be refused. All other cases will be adjudicated by a judge.

	3.4.11.1. The Category of the Offense. 
	<br/>
	The State defines three Categories of offenses:
	<ol class="indent4">
		<li>1. Egregious</li>
		<li>2. Serious</li>
		<li>3. Minor</li>
	</ol>
	<span class="indent3">The <em>nature</em> of the harm done to the victim(s) determines the Category of the offense.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.1.1. Category 1: Egregious
	<br/>
	Any offense that constitutes a violation of Human Rights or that undermines the Three Pillars of Independence is considered a Category 1 offense. 
	<br/><br/>
	The baseline punishment range, prior to applying additional tests, is:
	<br/>
	Minimum: Five (5) years incarceration and compensation/restitution for the victim(s), if the court deems it appropriate and if such compensation/restitution is realistic.
	<br/>
	Maximum: Thirty (30) years incarceration and compensation/restitution for the victim(s), if the court deems it appropriate and if such compensation/restitution is realistic.
	<br/>
	Full Citizens are reduced to Basic Citizenship status for the duration of their incarceration plus the longer of (a) twelve calendar months or (b) the waiting period determined by the court at time of sentencing.
	<br/>
	Non-Citizens <em>will</em> be removed from the country after serving their sentence.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.1.2. Category 2: Serious
	<br/>
	Any offense that constitutes a violation of Legal Rights or that involves physical violence, theft of property, damage or destruction of property, damage to the victim's reputation, financial loss above the amount of six standard work weeks' pay at the minimum wage as of the date of the offense, or interference in the victim's practical ability to exercise their individual liberty according to Kindergarten Wisdom is considered a Category 2 offense. 
	<br/><br/>
	The baseline punishment range, prior to applying additional tests, is:
	<br/>
	Minimum: Compensation/restitution for the victim(s) to the extent the offender is able to provide such.
	<br/>
	Maximum: Five (5) years incarceration plus compensation/restitution for the victim(s).
	<br/>
	Full Citizens are reduced to Basic Citizenship status for the duration of their incarceration plus the longer of (a) twelve calendar months or (b) the waiting period determined by the court at time of sentencing.
	<br/>
	Non-Citizens <em>may</em> be removed from the country after serving their sentence, at the discretion of the State and considering the recommendation of the court.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.1.3. Category 3: Minor
	<br/>
	Offenses that do not fall into Category 1 or 2 are considered Category 3 offenses. 
	<br/><br/>
	The baseline punishment range, prior to applying additional tests, is:
	<br/>
	Minimum: Warning.
	<br/>
	Maximum: Compensation/restitution for the victim(s) to the extent the offender is able to provide such.
	<br/>
	Citizenship status does not change.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.4.11.2. Initial Punishment Level. 
	<br/>
    The initial punishment is set at the time charges are brought, based on law enforcement's assessment of the <em>nature</em> of the harm done, and is set somewhere within the minimum and maximum punishment range for the given Category of offense. For violations of Statutes that specify a punishment range, the initial punishment will be set within that range. For other offenses, the Category of the offense will determine the range of punishments.
</p>
<p class="indent3">
	3.4.11.3. Adjusted Punishment Level
	<br/>
    The punishment may be increased or decreased based on the following tests. The tests are listed in the order in which they must be performed. The intent of the law is that each test in the series has a smaller potential effect on the adjusted punishment level than the test before it.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.1. Test 1: Extent of Harm Done
	<br/>
    The <em>extent</em> of the harm done in the offense is determined by the <em>number of victims</em> who were harmed and/or the <em>amount of property damage</em> that was done. The punishment level may be raised, at the discretion of the court, if more than one (1) victim was affected or a large amount or high value of property was damaged.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.2. Test 2: Age of the Victim(s) 
	<br/>
    If any victim was younger than the age of majority at the time of the offense, the punishment level may be raised, at the discretion of the court.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.3. Test 3: Offender's Intent 
	<br/>
    The offender's intent may lower the punishment level, at the discretion of the court.
    <ul class="indent4">
        <li>The offender intended harm: No change in punishment.</li>
        <li>The offender intended to carry out the act, but did not intend to harm anyone (negligence): Possible reduction in punishment.</li>
        <li>The offender did not intend to carry out the act, but acted carelessly (negligence): Possible reduction in punishment</li>
        <li>The offender did not intend to carry out the act, and did nothing to increase the risk (accident): Probable reduction in punishment, possible dismissal of the case</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.4. Test 4: Mitigating Circumstances 
	<br/>
    Mitigating circumstances may lower the punishment level, at the discretion of the court.
    <ul class="indent4">
        <li>The offender had to choose between two courses of action that were both illegal, and chose with the intent to minimize harm: Probable reduction in punishment, possible dismissal of the case.</li>
        <li>The act was unavoidable in the moment, but the situation arise in whole or in part through the offender's negligence: Reduction in punishment is unlikely, but not impossible.</li>
        <li>The act was unavoidable - genuinely accidental: Probable reduction in punishment, possible dismissal of the case.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.5. Test 5: Offender's Criminal History 
	<br/>
    If the offender has a history of repeated offenses, and/or is considered a danger to the public, the punishment level may be increased at the discretion of the court. If the offender has no criminal history a reduction in punishment level is possible, at the discretion of the court.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.6. Test 6: Offender's Attitude 
	<br/>
    If the offender has exhibited a cooperative, humble, and remorseful attitude through the investigation and trial, a reduction in punishment is possible, at the discretion of the court. If the offender has exhibited an arrogant, aggressive, belligerent attitude through the investigation and trial, an increase in punishment is possible, at the discretion of the court.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.7. Test 7: Character Witness Testimony
	<br/>
    In trial, the prosecution and the defense may call character witnesses, and individuals may volunteer as character witnesses without being called, and courts <em>must</em> allow them to testify. The court <em>may</em> consider this testimony to increase or reduce the punishment level, at its discretion.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.8. Test 8: Offender's Age
	<br/>
    If the offender was a minor at the time of the offense, the punishment may be reduced, at the court's discretion.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.9. Test 9: Offender's Mental State
	<br/>
    If the offender was not in a normal mental state at the time of the offense, and this was a factor in the offense, the punishment may be reduced, at the court's discretion.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.10. Test 10: Court's Judgment
	<br/>
    Judges and other professionals who work in the criminal justice system on a daily basis develop a sense of how to read people. The court's impressions of the offender may affect the level of punishment.
</p>
<p class="indent4">
	3.4.11.3.11. Test 11: Precedent
	<br/>
    After applying all other tests, the court will compare the resulting punishment with punishments levied in similar cases in the past to assure general consistency.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	3.4.12. Everyone who is arrested and/or charged with an offense is entitled to professional legal representation. An individual may engage the services of the attorney of their choice, or ask the State to provide an attorney, or may choose to represent themselves.

	3.4.27.1. Corollary: Should a Citizen voluntarily renounce their Citizenship as a form of protest, the State will not recognize the renunciation. The Citizen will continue to enjoy the rights and have the duties of a Citizen. Should a foreign government that does not recognize dual citizenship require an American to renounce their citizenship in order to live in the foreign country, the State will continue to recognize the American's Citizenship. The State may issue a document verifying they have received the renunciation, to satisty an administrative procedure of the foreign government, but in fact the American will always be a Citizen and may return to America at any time with no loss of rights.
