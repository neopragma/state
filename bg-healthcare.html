<h1>Backgrounder on Healthcare</h1>

<p>
One of the oddities about America at the time of writing is the fact approximately half the population does not comprehend the importance of maintaining the general health of the population. The goal to establish and maintain conditions under which Americans can live in freedom requires a healthy population. As Americans have proven themselves incapable of understanding and supporting this on their own, the State will define what healthcare services the population is entitled to, and the mechanism for providing them. This is definitional and is not open to debate.

<h2>1. The State's Position on Healthcare</h2>

<a name="right"/>
<h3>1.1. Healthcare Is a Human Right</h3>
<p>
The State recognizes <em>the right to live in freedom</em> as a human right, and <a href="bg-rights-and-duties.html"> defines it</a> not only as a right in principle, but in practical terms - unless the individual has the realistic ability to persue their personal liberty, they have no personal liberty, and their human rights are violated.
</p>
<p>
The State's purpose is to establish and maintain the conditions under which people can take care of their needs and fulfill their life ambitions. People cannot do this unless they are in generally good health.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<a name="pillars"/>
<h3>1.2. Healthcare Supports the Three Pillars of Independence</h3>
<p>
In the present-day US, it is common for people to go to work when they are sick. Many employers carefully craft work schedules in such a way that most workers are not categorized as "full time," and therefore have no company-paid benefits. Even for those who have company-paid or private-sector health insurance, the out-of-pocket costs of going to the doctor and the difficulty of getting time off from work to do so lead many people to forego check-ups and to keep working even when they really should take a break to recover.
</p>
<p>
Consider the effects of this practice on the Three Pillars of Independence, if the State allowed the situation to continue unchanged. A sick person working in the food industry could cause thousands or even millions of others to get sick, and some could die. A person working at a nuclear power station who could not maintain focus because of a mild illness could make a very costly (and possibly deadly) mistake. The list goes on.
</p>
<p>
A healthy workforce is an absolute requirement to maintain the country's independence, and therefore the individual liberty of its people. Universal healthcare is part of the operating cost of the system. It is not a "gift." 
</p>

<a name="economy"/>
<h3>1.3. Healthcare Enables Prosperity and Economic Strength</h3>
<p>
America is resource-rich and has a robust, wealth-generating economy. A healthy workforce is required to keep the economy going. Some people will be ill at any given time, but when the percentage of workers who call in sick or who function at less than their normal capacity because they are "under the weather" exceeds a very low number, the entire economy slows down. The quality of goods and services suffers, as the people making the products or providing the services are not operating at 100%. Then, we must invest effort in rectifying those problems instead of driving further economic growth and prosperity.
</p>
<p>
The cost of maintaining reasonbly good general health across the population is substantially lower than the cost of making up for the losses incurred through excessive worker illness, slow-downs, and rectifying malfunctioning products and poor services. 
</p>
<p>
On an individual level, people cannot create and enjoy the level of personal prosperity they would prefer when they are too sick to do much of anything beyond drag themselves to and from work every day. 
</p>

<a name="disparities">
<h2>2. Disparities Between the US System and the State's Purpose</h2>

<p>
Can Americans live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty under the present-day US healthcare system?
</p>
<p>
Those who value individualism to an extreme degree and do not wish to help their fellow citizens in any way are able to live by those values in the US. Healthcare services are not paid for by tax revenue, so these individualists can rest easy that their tax payments will not be used to help anyone else. 
</p>
<p>
However, Americans who value membership in a society and citizenship in a country that takes care of its own do not have the option to participate in a healthcare system like those in more-advanced countries. So, this portion of the population cannot live according their own values.
</p>
<p>
The present system in the US is not a healthcare system at all; it is an insurance system. We consider a system to be "an X System" if and only if the sole or main purpose of the system is X. The primary goal of the US system is to enrich insurance company owners and executives. Their personal wealth is the constant in the equation, and healthcare service is the variable. In a true healthcare system, the goal is to maximize the health of the population. Money is still important, as services must be paid for; but health is the constant and money is the variable.
</p>
<p>
There is a common belief in the US that many individuals and families declare bankruptcy due to medical bills. A number of studies have been carried out, but most of them had a political agenda to begin with, and may not be reliable. Beyond that, people who have political agendas have "interpreted" the studies in various ways, muddying the waters about the impact of healthcare costs on bankruptcies. Some wanted to make the case that a very large number of Americans declare bankruptcy for this reason, while others wanted to convince people the problem was entirely fabricated. Unfortunately, few people seemed to be interested in discovering the plain truth.
</p>
<p>
One attempt to discover the truth is a 2018 study by the American Council on Science and Health, a non-profit corporation whose mission is to verify or debunk popular myths about healthcare in the US. They examined the financial records of California adults between 25 and 64 who were "admitted to the hospital but not in at least the prior 3 years" to look for bankruptcy filings in the ensuring 6 year period. They found "4% of [these] bankruptcies were associated with a prior hospital admission." See <a href="https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/03/22/healthcare-costs-resulting-bankruptcy-overblown-myth-12738">https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/03/22/healthcare-costs-resulting-bankruptcy-overblown-myth-12738</a>. It was a good effort, even if it still appears to have a political motive, but does not clarify the issue nationwide or over a longer time period. 
</p>
<p>
We can see two truths through the fog. 
</p>
<p>
First, medical bills do result in bankruptcy for some number of American families each year. It is difficult to get a handle on the real numbers for reasons already mentioned. In any case, there is no question that it is a problem. The open question is how large a problem. 
</p>
<p>
Second, Americans <em>fear</em> financial loss due to medical bills. That fear drives behaviors that are counterproductive for the general health of the population. We do not know how much money, time, and effort is <em>not</em> invested in innovation and creativity because people are holding money aside against the possibility of large medical bills. We are unaware of any studies of that, and somewhat at a loss as to how such a study could be done. We are unaware of any studies to determine the overall economic impact of American workers trying to do their jobs while slightly sick, or of American workers who must leave the workforce prior to normal retirement age because of chronic health problems they developed over decades of avoiding routine medical checkups, due to cost.
</p>
<p>
The State's position is that when Americans do not have to worry about healthcare costs, they are free to pursue opportunities and ideas without restraint.  That can only be good for the economy. Apart from that individual benefit, they can also contribute more effectively to supporting the Three Pillars of Independence, which maintain the conditions under which their individual liberty is possible.
</p>

<h2>3. Overview of Healthcare Systems</h3>
<p>
In considering what sort of healthcare system could meet the needs of Americans under the State, we looked at various national healthcare systems around the world. It seems to us they all fall into four broad categories: Entirely government-operated, fully private, private with mandatory healthcare insurance, and private with the government acting as the single payer for services.
</p>
<a name="govoperated"/>
<h3>3.1. Government-Operated System</h3>
<p>
In a government-operated healthcare system, the national government owns and operates all the medical facilities and directly employs all healthcare providers - doctors, nurses, technicians, etc. Probably the best example of this type of system is (or <em>was</em>) the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom. It still exists today, but faces financial and organizational challenges. 
</p>
<p>
Another positive example is the Canadian healthcare system, which is similar to the NHS. Many Canadians find it very good, while others are dissatisfied. The complaints we have heard are from Canadians who have high incomes and do not wish to wait in line for non-emergency services. We do not consider this a fault in the system, as it is not a <em>basic</em> healthcare concern.
</p>
<p>
It is much easier to find negative examples of government-operated healthcare systems. Countries like Nicaragua, Vietnam, and North Korea do not perform well when it comes to supporting the health of their populations. These three examples are all different, and may hold lessons for us. 
</p>
<p>
Nicaragua is not a pure example of a government-operated system, as delivery of healthcare services involves collaboration between the private and public sectors. However, although Nicaragua has a constitutional democracy with three branches of government, superficially similar to the US model, the present governmental system was founded on Marxist-Leninist principles - universal healthcare is guaranteed to the people free of charge. The problem is that they have no practical way to pay for these services. This is an issue whenever a government is based on ideology instead of practicality. 
</p>
<p>
Typical of communist countries, Vietnam guarantees healthcare services to its people on principle and has difficulty paying for it in practice. It is a government-operated system, but is not managed centrally by the national government other than some level of coordination through the Ministry of Health. A  common feature of communist states is that government personnel are treated differently than everyone else - generally, better. In Vietnam, the Ministry of Health runs hospitals and medical services for government employees, while the provinces and cities run their own hospitals and other medical facilities. At the local level, districts and communes provide their own preventive and basic medical care. There seem to be no consistent or enforced nationwide standards. 
</p>
<p>
North Korea is an unusual case, in part because its status as a nation-state is not entirely clear. The Korean conflict is not officially over. Are there two Koreas or one, and if there is one Korea, which one is to be recognized? Besides that, North Korea has been ruled by the same family since its inception. The "throne" is handed down from generation to generation. Is this a "real" government?  
</p>
<p>
We raise this question not to criticize, but to provide context. Can North Korea be said to have a healthcare system at all, if it is not a "real" country? It is a closed country, and little information about how things work internally is available. An indicator of the quality of their healthcare system comes from soldiers who desert and cross the border into South Korea. They are malnourished and riddled with parasites. This is an elite group in North Korea, as it is a militaristic state. If the general health of an elite group is poor, it does not speak well of the healthcare system generally.
</p>


<a name="govcontrolled">
<h3>3.2. Government-Controlled, Privately-Operated System</h3>
</p>
<p>
In the Japanese healthcare system, the government exercises a great deal of control but does not directly operate medical facilities. All companies that provide medical services are required to be non-profit entities; for-profit healthcare services are not permitted. Clinics must be owned and operated by physicians, and physicians must be in decision-making positions in hospitals as well as on the government committee that sets the prices of medical services. These prices are revisited and updated every 2 years.
</p>
<p>
The system provides good physical care and relatively limited mental health care. The government pays for 70% of costs and the consumer pays the remaining 30%. That is on top of a 5% healthcare tax and a 2% tax for nursing home services. 
</p>
<p>
There are two forms of government health insurance. Social Health Insurance (SHI) applies to full-time employees of large companies. Japan National Health Insurance (NHI) covers employees of small businesses, self-employed and gig economy people, and foreign residents. 
</p>
<p>
Results speak for themselves, and the Japanese enjoy one of the world's longest life expectancies. However, physicians are not required to re-certify or to participate in ongoing education after they first qualify to practice medicine. 
</p>
<p>
We see some good things and some questionable things in this system. 
</p>

<a name="mandatoryinsurance"/>
<h3>3.3. Mandatory Private Health Insurance</h3>
<p>
The German healthcare system is largely private. It includes the requirement that everyone must purchase private healthcare insurance. However, the problems that immediately spring to mind from an American point of view are mitigated by government regulation of premiums and by the requirement that all covered medical services must be paid for - there is no arbitrary denial of claims, as in the US. 
</p>
<p>
Americans often describe the German healthcare system as a private system because of the mandate to purchase healthcare insurance, but it is more complicated than that. The government sets standards, but the system is said to be "self-governing." There are several organizations that are collectively responsible for this, some of which are part of the government (especially the <em>Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss</em> - Federal Joint Committee) and others are professional organizations or labor unions representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers, and insured people. 
</p>
<p>
All citizens must purchase private-sector health insurance, called <em>gesetzliche Krankenversicherung</em>, or "statutory health insurance." However, the premiums are not set arbitrarily by insurance companies. The premiums are based on one's income level. People whose earnings fall below a certain threshold must purchase statutory insurance, and those earning more than this amount can choose private insurance (<em>private Krankenversicherung</em>) or continue to buy the statutory insurance at a fixed premium rate (not increasing with further income gains). 
</p>
<p>
All statutory insurers jointly carry the risks and costs of medical care for the insured. All those covered by statutory insurance have rights for medical care and continued payment of wages while ill. 
</p>
<p>
Funding comes from the insurance premiums, plus excess tax revenue when necessary.
</p>
<p>
The reason for the apparently excessive complexity of the system is historical. The present system was not "invented" or "devised" in modern times. Instead, it evolved gradually starting in the Middle Ages, when guild members paid into a common fund which was used to help members in distress - health, finances, or other problems. There are still remnants of this system, as well as Industrial Era worker insurance systems dating from the late nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>
We do not see value for America in duplicating this sort of complexity.
</p>

<a name="singlepayer">
<h3>3.4. Mixed Public-Private System</h3>
<p>
Finland has a universal healthcare system that covers everyone residing in the country. It is funded by taxes and social security payments. Public healthcare facilities provide most of the basic care. There is a medical private sector, but it is small because the quality of public care is good. The main advantage of using private-sector providers is the reduced waiting time for services. 
</p>
<p>
While the healthcare system works very well in Finland, we do not think a similar system would work as well in America because of the characteristics of Americans. The people who choose government employment over private employment in America tend not to be the kind of people you would want handling your healthcare. 
</p>

<a name="singlepayer">
<h3>3.5. Single-Payer System</h3>

<p>
In a single-payer healthcare system, all healthcare services are provided by the private sector. Healthcare providers send their bills to the government, and the government collects taxes from the people to pay for healthcare services. The government pays all the bills - hence the term, "single-payer." Single-payer is in stark contrast to the US system, in which a person may receive multiple bills from service providers they never heard of, for services that are not clearly explained, and coming from multiple US states over a period of months or years. From the perspective of an individual, a single-payer system is infinitely preferable to this.
</p>
<p>
The government sets standards, oversees performance, and enforces regulations; but the government is not directly involved in healthcare services. 
</p>
<p>
This strikes us as the right balance between the private and public sectors. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> In the present-day US, many people who do not want Americans to have ready access to healthcare services mischaracterize single-payer healthcare systems as "government-run" healthcare systems. The intentional mischaracterization is a politically-motivated lie. The power elite want Americans to be uncertain and off-balance about matters such as health, employment, and pensions, so the people will be easier to control. 
</p>

<a name="nosystem">
<h3>3.6. No System</h3>

<p>
It might seem unnecessary to consider "no system at all" since it clearly cannot work, but we are designing the State to serve America in particular. A large percentage of Americans believe the best government is no government. In addition, one of the tenets of American Exceptionalism (as described by Lipset) is <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism. Therefore, "no system at all" would be a quintessentially American approach. Would that enable us to support the goals of the State?
</p>
<p>
Capitalism and free market economics can generate a great deal of innovation and economic growth. The private sector can perform almost all activities more efficiently and effectively than the government - but not everything. In cases where Americans' human rights, legal rights, or ability to pursue their individual liberty on a sustainable basis would be compromised by corporate greed, the State must take a hand. 
</p>
<p>
With "no system at all," healthcare services would be available only to those who could pay out of pocket or who could afford high-quality insurance. Prices for services and for insurance would be out of control - there would be no connection between price schedules and people's ability to pay. 
</p>
<p>
The lack of oversight would mean patients would never know whether their medications were safe or effective. It would be difficult and expensive to take legal action against incompetent or careless doctors or other service providers. Most Americans would be unable to afford to challenge the system. This would lead to general poor health across the work force as well as considerable expense for litigation. That money, time, and effort could be used for more constructive purposes.
</p>
<p>
This would inevitably lead to widespread health issues affecting our prosperty, practical freedom, and the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>
<p>
We reject this approach categorically.
</p>

<h2>4. Foundations of the State Healthcare System</h2>


<a name="standards"/>
<h3>4.1. Standards</h3>
<p>
Standards for medical practice, education, certification and licensure, performance, and accountability will be set by the relevant independent organizations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Dental Association, and the American Psychiatric Association. 
</p>
<p>
The State will monitor compliance and enforce standards through a body that includes State employees and medical professionals not employed by the State. Standards will be reviewed and updated as necessary every two years.
</p>

<a name="statesingle"/>
<h3>4.2. Single-Payer Model</h3>
<p>
The State will collect taxes for healthcare and pay for services. All service providers will be private-sector enterprises. The government will not provide medical services directly.
</p>

<a name="malpractice"/>
<h3>4.3. Medical Malpractice</h3>
<p>
Malpractice will be a criminal offense rather than a civil offense. This entirely eliminates the cost of malpractice insurance and encourages medical service providers to exercise due diligence in their work. The reduced cost of doing business means doctors can focus on their work and charge reasonable rates for their services, knowing their earnings will not be drained away by lawsuits. Patients would know that any doctors found guilty of malpractice would be unable to practice medicine by relocating or settling a civil suit, so they could feel more confident about visiting doctors.
</p>

<a name="incentives"/>
<h3>4.4. Incentives for New Practitioners</h3>
<p>
Qualifying students may complete their medical education free of charge in exchange for a period of service in less-desirable locations across the country.
</p>

<a name="protections"/>
<h3>4.5. Protections for Practitioners</h3>
<p>
In unusual situations when healthcare providers are at risk above and beyond what is normal in their professional activities, the State will enact any necessary measures to protect their health and safety. This is prompted by the behavior of many Americans who resisted vaccination and refused to wear masks during the Coronavirus pandemic, putting healthcare providers at unnecessary risk. 
</p>

<a name="disconnection"/>
<h3>4.6. Disconnection from Employment</h3>
<p>
In the present-day US, employers have too much sway over employees because benefits are channeled through them. Under the State, individuals' eligibility for healthcare services is disconnected from their employer. They can never be refused insurance or treatment due to "preexisting conditions" or for any other spurious reason. They need not worry about whether they have full-time or part-time status. They can freely change jobs without having to worry about the quality or cost of their new employer's health benefits. 
</p>

<a name="transparency"/>
<h3>4.7. Transparency</h3>
<p>
All fees and other costs for medical supplies, medications, treatments, lab processing, and other healthcare services will be public information. The performance history of physicians and other medical personnel will be public information.
