<h1>Backgrounder on International Relations</h1>

<p>
The goal of foreign policy under the State system is to ensure sustainable independence from foreign power and influence so that Americans can live according to their own values without external interference.

<h2>1. Principles</h2>

<p>
These are the principles on which our foreign policy is based.
</p>

<a name="pillars"/>
<h3>1.1. No Compromise On the Three Pillars of Independence</h3>

<p>
The <a href="bg-three-pillars.html">Three Pillars of Independence</a> are the foundation and framework for Americans' freedom. Without them, we have nothing. Therefore, the State will sign no international agreement that would undermine the Three Pillars. 
</p>

<a name="jurisdiction"/>
<h3>1.2. Our State Is for Our People</h3>

<p>
America is not the policeman of the world, the judge and jury for other countries, or the defender of human rights for anyone other than Americans. The State will not demand that any foreign government adjust its internal policies as a condition of entering into agreements with America. By the same token, the State will not tolerate any interference in our own internal affairs. The State will also take an interest in the stability and neurtrality of our "neighborhood" - the Americas.
</p>

<a name="approach"/>
<h2>2. Approach</h2>

<p>
These are general guidelines for the State's approach to international relations.
</p>

<a name="relationships"/>
<h3>2.1. Relationships</h3>

<p>
Present-day US foreign policy consists of interventions in the domestic affairs of foreign countries, demands for support when the US needs support, economic pressure on foreign governments to force them to do what the US wants, and overt or covert military operations to forcibly change governments when it is convenient for the US. When a situation emerges in which the US wants a particular outcome, diplomats must scurry around trying to wrangle support from various governments because the US has not already established positive working relationships with those governments. US diplomats only knock on the door when they need something, and by then the problem is urgent and there is no time to build relationships.
</p>
<p>
Not to make light of it, but the US is much like Gandalf in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. He only showed up when there was trouble, so people associated his arrival with trouble. Even when the US has good intentions, and even when US assistance would be of great value to others, people naturally associate the country with trouble because the Americans only show up when there is trouble.
</p>
<p>
The State's approach will be to build positive working relationships with as many governments as possible, regardless of whether America "needs" the help or support of those governments in the moment. We are always engaged in a constructive way. The intent is that when unexpected problems arise, many governments will be ready to offer support naturally, because of the ongoing positive relationship with the State. 
</p>
<p>
This means engaging with governments whose policies are distasteful to us. The key point to remember is they are not us. The form of government, human rights records, and propaganda of those governments are irrelevant. Only the Three Pillars of Independence are relevant (to us). 
</p>
Many Americans will recoil at the thought of doing business with a foreign country that engages in human rights abuses within their own territory. The advantage of our approach to foreign policy is that when America is fully independent, Americans can freely make the choice not to do business with such countries. As long as there are any dependencies on the country in question, Americans are not free to step away from engagement. Due to the economic strength of America, it will be in other countries' best interests to engage with us. Therefore, in a roundabout way, our hands-off policy may influence other governments to refrain from human rights abuses. The State will not attempt to influence other countries' human rights abuses from a moralistic position.
</p>

<a name="stability"/>
<h3>2.2. Seek Stability First, Then Peace</h3>

<p>
We observe national governments that seek peace "at all costs" often give way to bullies and tyrants in the hope they can avoid war. The problem is the phrase, "at all costs." When facing a belligerent and ambitious foreign power, "all costs" may be too much to pay for the illusion of "peace."
</p>
<p>
We further observe governments that focus on the <em>stability</em> of the global order and of bilateral relationships enjoy more peace and prosperity than those that simply avoid conflict at any cost. 
</p>
<p>
The State will focus on stability first, using peaceful or forceful methods as necessary to ensure stability. Stability is the foundation for genuine and lasting peace. There will be times when an aggressor disrupts the system and introduces instability, and they must be dealt with. We prefer peace, but we must remain cognizant of the costs and make choices that yield the maximum benefit and/or minimum harm, in keeping with utilitarian ethics.
</p>

<a name="neutrality"/>
<h3>2.3. Default Position of Neutrality</h3>

<p>
In any given situation when international tension arises, the State will confer with all governments with which we have positive working relationships and seek collaborative approaches to restore stability. We will not rush to "choose sides" in the conflict. 
</p>
<p>
We observe <em>stability</em> is often better served when powerful states take a neutral position than when they back one side or the other. However, this is not a hard-and-fast rule to be followed mindlessly. Maintaining the Three Pillars of Independence is always our primary goal in international relations. Should we determine that choosing a side will serve our national interests better than maintaining neutrality, then we will choose that side. We expect that most international conflicts can be resolved without recourse to war if the more-powerful players remain calm and demonstrate steady, consistent leadership.
</p>

<a name="econpower"/>
<h3>2.4. Use Economic Power Generously</h3>

<p>
	As the preeminent economic power in the world, America can afford to be generous with funding development programs and helping other countries in need as a way to build positive working relationships and encourage a willingness to cooperate in future, when we may need their support.
</p>
<p>
	This also helps to maintain the stability of the global order by building the security and prosperity of as many countries as possible. This approach also enables greater prosperity, as countries that are stable, prosperous, and secure make better business partners, customers, and suppliers than countries that are "held down" as a way to make them dependent.
</p>
<p>
	The State's policy to make use of America's economic strength is driven, in part, by demographic trends. As the boomer generation moves out of the workforce and is replaced by gen-X, which is a much smaller cohort, America will have difficulty supporting social services. There will be more people drawing benefits than there are contributing to the system. Eventually, gen-X will retire and gen-Y will reach its maximum earning capacity. Gen-Y is another large cohort, almost as large as the boomers. But in the interim, when gen-X is the primary engine of wealth-generation, there will be economic challenges.
</p>
<p>
	Most analysts today (mid-2022) agree that all developed countries are facing a gradual decline in population, and will probably face extended periods of economic recession in the coming decades. But they tend to look only at the usual suspects - western Europe, Japan and South Korea, and the anglophone countries. Most analyses never mention Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, or Africa at all. Yet, many countries in those regions have younger populations than the "developed" world.
</p>
<p>
	 The State will pay due attention to these regions, and use America's economic strength to help them develop into stable and prosperous trade partners. During gen-X's ascendancy, we can bolster America's economy through trade with these emerging economies. That approach represents a radical departure from US foreign policy. It marks the end of the Bretton Woods era, bringing new economic partners to the fore. 
</p>

<a name="ring"/>
<h3>2.5. Categories of Nation-States</h3>

<p>
The State emphasizes relationships with nation-states that are important for the sustainable independence of America. Sustainable independence is the foundation for Americans' freedom. This is more important than alignment with foreign governments that share similar political systems or with foreign cultures that share basic values. 
</p>
<p>
It is possible to group nation-states into various categories as a way to consider how to approach relations, at least at a high level. There will be special cases that cross the boundaries between catagories, or that belong to two conflicting categories simultaneously. 
</p>

<h4>2.5.1. Category 1: Global Economic Powers</h4>
</p>
<p>
<em>Circa</em> 2022, the only global economic powers are the United States and China. America, which inherits from the United States, would continue to function in this role after the transition to the State. Using 2022 figures, America accounts for about 24% of global GDP, and China for about 18%. The #3 economic power in the world is Japan, which accounts for under 6% of global GDP. No other single country or economic bloc has economic clout comparable to that of Japan. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Per</em> 20th-century thinking, the global powers are considered to be those that have the largest stockpiles of nuclear warheads. In our view, the true leaders of the world are the major <em>economic</em> powers. As of 2022, there are exactly two of those, America and China, plus Japan as a second tier. The two global economic powers should collaboratively steer the world toward stability, prosperity, and peace. 
</p>
<p>
There are a number of smaller economies that are successful and important, even if they lack global reach. These are mainly (a) manufacturing centers, like South Korea and Germany; (b) agricultural exporters, like Thailand and Uruguay; or (c) suppliers of raw materials and resources, like Brazil and Russia. China itself is primarily a manufacturing center, and that is its strength. America is unique in that it is an <em>engine of economic growth</em>. There is nothing else like it in the world, in that sense. This places us in a very favorable position to support our independence through economic influence.
</p>
<p>
In August, 2022, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi toured east Asia and visited several countries in the region. She included Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, and which the United Nations and some 180 national governments (including the US) officially recognize as a province of China under the One China Policy. The Chinese government reacted strongly, launching military exercises around the island and publishing a mass of anti-American propaganda. Xi Jinping met with Vladimir Putin for a photo-op and to announce that China regards the US as responsible for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, owing to the expansion of NATO. That position is a shift from China's official rhetoric prior to Speaker Pelosi's visit, when they maintained official neutrality and repeatedly expressed the hope Russia and Ukraine could resolve their differences peacefully. Of course, we don't know what was happening behind the scenes during several phone calls between Xi and Putin since the invasion; it is unlikely the Chinese leadership revealed their true thinking <em>via</em> public statements. 
</p>
<p>
For purposes of our model, this series of events tells us that no foreign government is dependable. If we want to steer the global economy in the post-Bretton Woods world, the most logical approach is to partner with China; but we can't count on China to be consistent. We have to make it worth their while to collaborate with us. We also need to have a fallback plan in case China proves to be an undesirable partner. We can build on our positive economic and political relationships with Category 2 countries to achieve the same goal; it will just take more time, effort, and money. In fact, it would be prudent to develop both avenues of collaboration at the same time. 
</p>


<h4>2.5.2. Category 2: Principal Trade Partners</h4>

<p>
Certain countries are of particular importance to America for maintaining our independence, even if we are capable of surviving without them. Our international relations will focus mainly on these countries. They will also be the second tier of support for the new global economic order; possibly the first tier, if China fails to operate appropriately.
</p>

<h4>2.5.3. Category 3: Immediate Geographical Neighbors</h4>

<p>
Countries with direct land borders on America are strategically positioned to help or harm our ability to maintain our independence. Inheriting from the US, we have friendly borders with Mexico and Canada. All neighbors have their disagreements, but on the whole these are friendly borders. In any case, they are non-militarized borders, and that is where excessive cost and risk would come in.
</p>
<p>
We list Texas among neighboring countries and among principal trade partners. We do not assume Texas would remain in America after the transition, as our observation of the US <em>circa</em> 2022 is that Texans do not share the fundamental values of America. They and we would be happier if we did not have to try and accommodate each other in day-to-day life. It is better for both if we keep the relationship at the level of international trade, and we stay out of one another's internal affairs.
</p>
<p>
Texas is a natural economic partner for America, and would immediately be near the top of the list of principal trade partners. They are also important as a border state and as a member of our "neighborhood." America would make special efforts to support the success of the nascent Texan nation-state. They have every chance of success, owing to the diversity of their natural resources, their high-tech industries, their manufacturing capability, access to the sea <em>via</em> the Gulf of Mexico, non-militarized land borders with two important trade partners, and central location for transportation and shipping throughout North and Central America. 
</p>
<p>
Our only interest beyond that would be to ensure Texas did not become a gateway to the Americas for hostile foreign powers. That is another reason America would be proactive in helping Texas become established and stable as an independent country. We trust the leaders of Texas, for their part, would also understand the importance of not inviting any sort of threat to America into our back yard, and we would never need to have that conversation.
</p>

<h4>2.5.4. Category 4: The Americas</h4>

<p>
Imagine you live in a beautiful, spacious house perched in the midst of a lovely garden. Imagine that garden surrounded by a high double wall topped with concertina wire, with a dog run between the walls, and machine-gun towers constructed at intervals all around. Beyond the walls are barren fields, razed of vegetation and seeded with mines. Searchlights slice the night and helicopters prowl the sky. It is not safe for you to go for a walk in the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine the same house and garden, but this time there are no walls, dogs (except friendly pets), machine-gun towers, concertina wire, mine fields, searchlights, or helicopters. Instead, the property is nestled in a clean, prosperous, safe neighborhood where everyone lives in a fine house and it is perfectly safe to go for a walk, day or night. 
</p>
<p>
Which house would you rather live in?
</p>
<p>
Yes, we agree. But, for some reason, many Americans would prefer to live in the first house. That is why they ignore the root causes of "illegal immigration" and want to surround the country with a wall. The rationale escapes us, as it is far less expensive and less troublesome to establish a clean, safe, stable, prosperous <em>neighborhood</em> than it is to wall ourselves off from our neighbors. With everyone living in a fine house of their own, they would not need to leave their home countries as refugees. 
</p>
<p>
A key part of the State's foreign policy is to establish and sustain a safe neighborhood for America; one that is not an open door for hostile countries to enter the hemisphere to strip the land of resources and to set up military bases from which to attack us. It is, in fact, an important aspect of supporting the Defense Pillar. (See the <a href="bg-three-pillars.html">Backgrounder on the Three Pillars of Independence</a> for more information.)
</p>




<h4>2.5.5. Category 5: Favorable or Neutral View of America</h4>

<p>
Outmoded Cold War thinking leads many Americans to categorize other countries as "friends" or "enemies," but the vast majority are neither. Most governments do their best to meet the needs of their own people and to pursue their own national interests.
</p>
<p>
The majority of countries in the world are neutral, or non-aligned. Most of those have either a favorable or a neutral view of America. The State's policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of foreign countries, combined with the policy of using our economic strength to build positive working relationships, is expected to lead to stable, peaceful, mutually-beneficial, long-term economic relationships with nearly all other countries.
</p>

<h4>2.5.6. Category 6: Neutral Countries with an Unfavorable View of America</h4>

<p>
Some neutral or non-aligned countries have an unfavorable view of America. In most cases, this is a result of United States foreign policy starting in the late 19th century, at the beginning of the country's imperialist period, and continuing to the present day. The differences between US and State foreign policy might change some of these into Category 5 countries. In any case, the State would work with Category 6 countries using economic generosity and consistently staying out of their internal affairs to shift their thinking toward Category 5. This is not because we are keen to make friends, but because the fewer enemies we have - and the fewer neutral countries are inclined to support our enemies' international initiatives - the easier it will be to maintain our independence and freedom. 
</p>

<h4>2.5.7. Category 7: Openly Hostile towards America</h4>

<p>
In view of the US' aggressive and domineering foreign policy over the past 130 years or so, surprisingly few countries are openly hostile towards the US. There are three main adversarial countries - Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Depending on immediate political concerns, China sometimes operates as Category 7 and sometimes as Category 6. Others are secondary players that are aligned with one of the main adversaries, such as Belarus aligned with Russia. It remains to be seen whether America under the new State system will be able to normalize relations with some or all of these. Each one is a special case, as well. The same strategy will not apply to all of them.
</p>
<p>
Our primary strategy will be to use our economic clout to improve relations with these countries and move them into Category 6 or, if possible, Category 5. If it proves impossible to normalize relations, we believe America would be able to deal with these threats effectively, even if worse comes to worst.
</p>

<h4>2.5.8. Existential Threats to America</h4>

<p>
While we consider economic power to be paramount in the 21st century, the old stockpiles of nuclear warheads have not disappeared, and many weapons are in the hands of aggressive, arrogant countries. There is no practical way to stop them from doing considerable damage, should they decide to act. As we cannot stop them, the next-best strategy is to ensure we are resilient enough to survive a nuclear war. 
</p>
<p>
This is a subject most Americans are loathe to think about, and that is understandable. But we do not have the luxury to ignore the possibility of war. Resiliency will be key to survival.
</p>

<h5>2.5.8.1. Russia</h5>

<p>
Russia is the primary nuclear threat in the world as of 2022. Russia has some unique historical and cultural characteristics that make it a special case. If we may resort to simplistic terms for the sake of saving space, we can describe Russia as a tribal society centered on ethnic Russians. They use non-Russian citizens as a buffer to protect the "real" Russians. For example, in their 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia deployed non-Russian soldiers almost exclusively.
</p>
<p>
The ethnic Russian population is concentrated in a flat plain that is easy to approach and hard to defend. There are nine easy approaches, and all have been used by various invading forces over the centuries. During the Imperial and Soviet periods, the Russians surrounded themselves with buffer states to absorb the impact of any invading force. Lacking these buffer states today, they feel exposed and vulnerable. Three approaches to the Russian heartland lie in Ukrainian territory.
</p>
<p>
The Russian heartland has only two metropolitan areas with populations over 2 million. Should Russia pose an existential threat to America, it would be feasible to eliminate all the significant ethnic Russian population centers without depleting our nuclear capability. It would require the destruction of only the Moscow and St. Petersburg greater metropolitan areas, a task that can be accomplished with fewer than 20 warheads out of a total inventory of about 5,500. Other major cities have majority non-Russian, even non-Slavic, populations, and would not continue to make war on us after the Russian heartland had been eliminated. Those populations also have a tribal mentality, and no deep loyalty to the Russians.
</p>
<p>
Russia poses no threat to the continental US from conventional warfare. However, they have several thousand nuclear weapons deployed and ready for use. It would be prudent to monitor them closely and to act preemptively when signs indicate they will soon launch an attack, to suppress their offensive capability. It will not be feasible to deny their offensive capability altogether; America would suffer significant damage in a war against Russia. If we build decentralized and resilient infrastructure and industrial facilities, we should be able to survive such a war and rebuild. Unfortunately, a more-positive outcome is unlikely.
</p>

<h5>2.5.8.2. North Korea</h5>

<p>
North Korea, a belligerent and very vocal proponent of using nuclear weapons whose government frequently threatens the US, has only one large city, Pyongyang, and a handful of important military installations. It is very likely that America could shut down North Korea entirely without resorting to nuclear weapons, even over the direct objections of China and Russia, with few to no repercussions at home.
</p>
<p>
Korea is another special case, and quite a unique one. Officially, the Korean Conflict, which started in 1950, is still ongoing. A ceasefire was negotiated in 1953 and remains in effect. The border between North and South Korea is heavily militarized and there is great tension between the two. 
</p>
<p>
Korea has been divided for such a long time that reunification may no longer be an option. However, a peaceful resolution to the conflict is possible. One small sign of progress is the fact the two Koreas field joint sports teams in the Olympics and other international competitions, under the name Unified Korea and a neutral flag. 
</p>
<p>
Korea became divided as a consequence of the Cold War between the US and the USSR. As such, we consider it a holdover from a bygone era, and a situation that needs to be resolved so that the world can move forward. A simplified, capsule history of the situation is that the US backed one side and the USSR backed the other. The North pushed through the peninsula and almost took the whole territory before the US-backed South pushed them back. As the fighting drew close to the Yalu River (Amrok River, in Korean) on the Chinese border, the Chinese stepped in to support the North. The result was a stalemate with the two armies facing off on the "38th parallel," a reference to latitude 38&deg; north.
</p>
<p>
We think the most practical peaceful resolution to the situation is to recognize the two Koreas as separate countries, permanently. In that way, North Korea can be brought into the global economic order in a planned and manageable way, without bloodshed. If we are successful in establishing a positive working relationship with China, the most practical way to achieve this would be to collaborate to guide the two Koreas toward resolution. If that does not happen, then we will need to pursue other avenues.
</p>
<p>
The challenge in working with North Korea is their leadership. Ostensibly a communist system, the country is in fact a monarchy. The head of state holds supreme executive power individually, and that power is handed down from generation to generation within the Kim family. One could say it is less a traditional monarchy than a sort of mafia-style system, with the reigning Kim as the mafia Don. They maintain the colors, words, and decorations of communism because that is how the USSR set them up originally, but these things are meaningless on a practical level.
</p>
<p>
This is an inherently unstable system. To make matters worse for us, one of the key propaganda points the Kim family has used to build popular support is to blame the United States for its problems. It is possible they will launch an attack on South Korea, Japan, and/or the US using their domestically-developed nuclear and missile technologies, in which they have invested over 85% of GNP for the past 35 years. They have deliberately built a militaristic society over a period of decades. Therefore, they may not be open to discussions.
</p>

<h5>2.5.8.3. Iran</h5>

<p>
Iran has sophisticated domestically-developed missile technology. They are actively building a nuclear arsenal while pretending they are not doing so. Meanwhile, they provide support to any state that opposes America, providing missiles, weapons, ammunition, food and medicine, and logistical assistance. They take every opportunity to undermine US interests. Iran may potentially become a direct existential threat to America, or it may become a significant supporter of such a power, or member of a coalition that is collectively a threat. 
</p>
<p>
The country consists largely of various different populations that live in mountainous areas, not well connected with each other physically, historically, culturally, or linguistically. Therefore, it will not be necessary to "destroy" Iran to suppress any serious threat they may pose to America. By destroying six or seven key military bases and, possibly, the city of Tehran, Iranian aggression can be shut down. 
</p>
<p>
Iran's hatred of the US stems from history. In 1907, British and US petroleum companies wanted a foothold in Iran, and they were backed by those countries' military and intelligence functions. When Mohammad Mosaddegh was elected Prime Minister in 1953, he wanted to audit the records of British petroleum company Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a predecessor of British Petroleum. The company refused, and the Iranian parliament voted to nationalize the oil industry and throw out foreign companies. Britain and the US responded by orchestrating a coup and installing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on August 19, 1953. 
</p>
<p>
A period of dictatorship, secret police, and assorted human rights violations against the people of Iran continued until the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which Americans remember as the "Iran Hostage Crisis." Since that time, the government of Iran has characterized the US as "The Great Satan" and has sponsored an annual celebration called "Death to America Day."
<p>
<p>
It is possible the Iranian government would recognize the American State is not the same as the United States that it replaced, and relax some of the anti-American rhetoric. It is also possible they will continue the rhetoric in order to maintain domestic support and stability, given the fact the population of the country is so diverse and not every ethnic group is happy about being dominated by the central government. Some of these groups have close ties with neighboring countries, and Tehran's hold on them is a little tenuous. These include Turks, Kurds, Baluchis, Lurs, Turkmens, Arabs, and various smaller mountain tribes and nomads. Iran is not a single nation-state by nature, but rather a conglomeration. Instability in the general global order will easily translate into instability within Iran. To maintain control, the government could use America as a "common enemy" to unite the people. In that case, we would be compelled to shut them down.
</p>


<h5>2.5.8.4. China</h5>

<p>
	If China is our preferred partner to guide the new global economic order, then why do we consider how we would handle a direct war with China? First, we have not consulted China (or anyone) about this model. They may not be interested in working with America. Second, the current Chinese government is unreliable, unless you mean to say they can be relied upon to switch loyalties, lie, and stab you in the back. They are not "nice," and that's okay because it isn't the reason we see them as an effective economic partner. Besides, the present-day US government is also not nice, and neither are we; we have the specific purpose to ensure sustainable independence and freedom for Americans. 
</p>
<p>
	China might decline the invitation to partner with us. In that case, they may continue to operate in more-or-less the same way as they do today. There is a small chance they would decide to become a genuine existential threat to America, sooner or later. What is our general approach to that situation? 
</p>
<p>
	This would be a serious war with significant damage to our side and civilian losses in the millions likely, and in the tens of millions possibly. China cannot be physically destroyed in the same way as Russia can be, nor can it be suppressed by striking a handful of key targets in the way that Iran or North Korea can be. We could inflict civilian casualties in excess of 100 million, and even that horrific number would not cripple the country. 
</p>
<p>
	China does not have the five required aspects of maximum resiliency, but it does have the first one: Size. Our objective cannot be to destroy China. Apart from the practical impossibility of it, we would not want that outcome, as we would need China to become operational again as soon as possible after the war. 
</p>
<p>
	Our objective in such a war must be to bring down the communist party. If we can cause the central government to fall, China would almost certainly stop fighting on a large scale or in a cohesive way. There would be pockets of resistance here and there. It would take some time to settle things down.
</p>
<p>
	Although they talk about reunification of Taiwan, the mainland itself is not entirely unified. With the fall of the central government, several things could happen in a short time. China could break up into several smaller countries. Some obvious and natural fault lines include Taiwan/Fujian, Guangdong (Hong Kong), Xizang (Tibet), Xinjiang (home of the Uyghurs), and Nei Mongol (Inner Mongolia). Other divisions are possible, probably along ethnic lines - the Han are the dominant group, and other groups do not receive equal treatment. Neighboring countries would press existing territorial claims - India, Bhutan, Vietnam (Paracel Islands), Japan (Senkaku Islands). Some territorial disputes that are officially resolved could become open again; those are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, and Tajikistan. In fact, there is not a single direct neighbor of China that doesn't have a territorial dispute with them.
</p>
<p>
	China is not as unified or as stable as it may appear from the outside. Should they initiate a war against America, it is likely other countries would join in, not because they love America but because they have grievances against China. These could potentially include some of the bordering countries as well as Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the Phillippines, Indonesia, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Peru. It is possible they would face internal insurrection as well, from Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia if not more. 
</p>
<p>
	Following a war with America, China would still exist in some form, but would not be able to integrate Taiwan into the mainland. On the other hand, Taiwan might be in a position to integrate the mainland - or parts of it - under its form of government. Clearly, this is the opposite long-term outcome from what the communist party wants. Therefore, it would be a singularly foolish decision to enter into a war against America.
</p>


<h5>2.5.8.5. Resiliency</h5>

<p>
A nuclear war cannot be "won" in the usual sense of the word, but it can be survived. The key to survival is resiliency. We cannot prevent every missile from finding its target. We have to expect significant physical damage and high civilian casualties. The more resiliency we can build into our infrastructure, our industry, our agricultural capacity, and our military, the greater the chances we can survive with enough of the country intact to rebuild. We understand that is not the happiest story possible, but we must deal with reality.
</p>
<p>
The first aspect of resiliency is size. America has about 40 metropolitan areas with populations above 2 million, spread out over a very large area. There are too many targets for it to be feasible to destroy the country physically. America would still be almost fully functional following a heavy nuclear attack. 
</p>
<p>
The second aspect of resiliency is to design things such that they are hard to disable or destroy. An example of this design approach is the automated teller machine (ATM). People can drag them away on chains behind a truck, lift them off the ground and drop them repeatedly, try to pry them open with crowbars, and even try to blow them open with explosives. It isn't too hard to make the machine unusable for a normal transaction, but it is harder to do any real damage to the unit, and much harder to access the cash inside it. 
</p>
<p>
The third aspect of resiliency is decentralization. When a country has a critical defense capability centralized in one location or in just a few locations, it is vulnerable to attack. The State would work to create decentralized capability and a decentralized and multiply-redundant infrastructure to support it for the Three Pillars of Independence. The most likely existential threats to America are not decentralized. They can be suppressed or even destroyed by striking a handful of targets.
</p>
<p>
The fourth aspect of resiliency is the capability to rebuild quickly and at low cost. For certain capabilities and certain types of infrastructure, rebuilding will never be "low cost" in an absolute sense. However, by designing for modularity, replaceability, maintenance, and ease of construction, we can mitigate the cost of rebuilding and enable <em>relatively</em> rapid recovery after a war. Technology can be helpful with this. For example, 3D printing technology can be used to produce most or all the parts of a critical infrastructure component on site, saving manufacturing and shipping costs and reducing the total time to get the component in place.
</p>
<p>
The fifth aspect of resiliency is deterrence. We would establish a deterrent effect by creating hard economic dependencies on America. When our enemies are dependent on us for their basic needs, the only way they can destroy us is to destroy themselves as well. The 20th century notion of deterrence was <em>mutually-assured destruction</em> (MAD). The idea was, "If you attack us, we will attack you in return." The 21st century notion of deterrence is, "If you attack us, in the process you will debilitate yourself automatically. We need not attack you in return." This is preferable, as "destruction" is not necessary. Destruction would only occur if an enemy insisted on it.
</p>

<h4>2.5.9. Category 8: Ungoverned Territories</h4>

<p>
Unfortunately, some areas of the world have no stable government at all, as of 2022. In cooperation with our international partners, the State's policy will be to help stabilize these regions so that they can operate normally and provide at least a basic standard of living for the people who live there. 
</p>


<h4>2.5.10. Category 10: Former US Territories</h4>

<p>
From the beginning of the United States through the end of World War II, the country underwent growth. Article 4, Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States defines the process by which a "territory" can become incorporated into the United States as a "state". Congress has incorporated some territories at a status less than that of a state; these are called "organized" territories. 
</p>
<p>
Throughout the period of growth, the US acquired territories by various means, including:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Physically displacing the indigenous population of an area with English-speaking settlers</li>
		<li>Military conquest or threat of same</li>
		<li>Purchase</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
The basic process to acquire territory in the North American continent was by physically displacing the indigenous population. This process was supplemented by military conquest (e.g., the Mexican-American War and the various battles with indigenous peoples). 
</p>
<p>
Territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean were acquired by military conquest, sometimes involving a direct invasion by the US (the Phillippines), sometimes by threatening to bombard the civilian population (Hawaii), and sometimes "by default" after taking territory from an enemy that ultimately retreated (namely, Japan in World War II). 
</p>
<p>
Another way the US acquired large swathes of territory was by purchasing them - the Louisiana Purchase, from France; the Alaska Purchase, from Russia. Of course, the French and the Russians had aquired those territories <em>via</em> the usual colonialist/imperialist methods.</p>
<p>
The status of territories changes with time. Sometimes they may become independent countries (Phillippines), sometimes they may become states (Missouri, Arizona, etc.), sometimes they may settle into a long-term territorial status with some degree of autonomy (Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Most of the holdings are very small, uninhabited islands or atolls in the Pacific Ocean that had been the sites of battles with the Imperial Japanese forces in World War II. The reason they became US territories was that the only people still standing on them after a battle were US soldiers. The US had no particular need for these islands after the war, but ended up "owning" them.
</p>
<p>
Significant territories are those that have a permanent, non-military population. There are only five of those:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>American Samoa</li>
		<li>Guam</li>
		<li>Northern Mariana Islands</li>
		<li>Puerto Rico</li>
		<li>US Virgin Islands</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Each one has a slightly different status with respect to the US government. Each has its own government, and they are all different. Each has a different level of autonomy from the US. Only Puerto Rico has a significant population size, with over 3 million people. All are "organized" as that is defined in the US Constitution, with the exception of American Samoa. Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands have "commonwealth" status with the US. People born in these territories are US citizens automatically, except the Samoans. 
</p>
<p>
As the territories are not states, they lack full representation in the US government. Puerto Rico has a single representative in the House, known as a Resident Commissioner. This is an "at-large" representative who represents the entire territory of Puerto Rico. The Resident Commissioner does not have the same voice in US government as the representatives from the states. 
</p>
<p>
For the very small territories, there are advantages to being affiliated with the US due to the larger country's economic power and international influence, and the opportunity to travel to the US for education and work. For Puerto Rico, the relationship appears (to us) to be a mixed blessing. It is easy for Puerto Ricans to go to the US to work and set up small businesses, but they are not well represented in the natonal government. The island benefits from investment from US corporations, but cannot rely on the US for assistance when needed. For example, after Hurricane Maria in 2017, the then-President of the US responded to Puerto Rican pleas for aid by tossing paper towels into the audience of hurricane survivors. To this day (2022), Puerto Rico has received no meaningful assistance from the US to recover from damage caused by that storm.
</p>
<p>
The State is not interested in imperialism. Our general strategy will be to ask the people living in these territories to choose the status they want. The new America has no states, so the option to become a state is not on the table. However, the residents of a former US territory could choose to become Americans. Then, the territory would become part of America, even if it is separated from the North American continent by some distance. The people could choose independence, and the State would recognize the territory as a country and assist in getting it established successfully. If, for some reason, the people voted to maintain some kind of commonwealth status with America, the State would have to negotiate terms on a case-by-case basis. It is not an arrangement we seek, but we will honor the wishes of the residents of the territories. 
</p>




<h4>2.5.11. Non Self-Governing Territories</h4>

<p>
It is our view that every distinct cultural group that wants to establish their own nation-state ought to be free to make that choice with the congratulations and support of other countries. The United Nations already works to gain the independence of non-self-governing areas by encouraging the "owning" countries to permit referenda. The State will support the will of the people in each area. For territories that do not choose independence, the State will interact with the "owning" government only, for purposes of international rlations.
</p>
<p>
In cases when ownership of the territory is in dispute, the State will cooperate with other governments and with the UN to help the parties arrive at a mutually-acceptable, peaceful resolution. 
</p>

<h4>2.5.12. Special Cases</h4>

<p>
There are several special cases that do not fit neatly into one of the above categories, and that require a unique approach. 
</p>

<h5>2.5.12.1. Cuba</h5>

<p>
Cuba is a close neighbor of America. As of 2022 it fits into Category 4 (Americas, our "neighborhood") and Category 7 (openly hostile towards America). To realize our vision for a "safe neighborhood," the State must work to move Cuba into Category 5 (favorable or neutral view of America) as well as Category 4. A generous economic program will probably go a long way toward that goal. 
</p>
<p>
However, a large population of Cuban expatriates, descended from escapees from the communist revolution there, live in America. There will have to be appropriate measures to accommodate them on the domestic front. 
</p>
<p>
The State's approach is not "regime change," as the official position is not to interfere in anyone's internal affairs, no matter how different their "way" may be from our own. If Cuba remains communist but moves into Category 5, the Cuban expatriate community in America will not be pleased.
</p>
<p>
A small population of expatriates whose cause is rapidly fading into the past cannot direct the foreign policy of America. Yet, they are Americans, and the State must do something to bring them a level of satisfaction with the ultimate solution for Cuba.
</p>

<h5>2.5.12.2. Korea</h5>

<p>
Korea is currently divided between the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). 
</p>
<p>
The Korean peninsula had been part of the Japanese Empire. When the Allies defeated the Empire at the end of World War II, the USSR and US were in possession of Korea. Soon, those two countries fell out, and were in conflict. The USSR supported North Korea - the region they controlled - and the US supported South Korea - the region they controlled. 
</p>
<p>
The fighting escalated to full-scale war, but it was undeclared. For that reason, we refer to the war as the Korean Conflict rather than the Korean War. The conflict did not resolve the question of which Korea should prevail. The situation in 2022 is that a cease-fire has been in effect since 1953. Officially, the Korean Conflict is still ongoing.
</p>
<p>
As of 2022, the US still supports South Korea. North Korea has no genuine allies, but China and Iran do business with them. Iran increases the risk of broader war by trading in arms. China exercises some influence to keep the military ambitions of the North in check, through diplomatic channels as well as by imposing economic pressure, as it controls most of the coal supply and food imports for North Korea. 
</p>
<p>
In our view, a lasting resolution of this conflict will require either (a) the reunification of Korea into a single nation-state, or (b) official acceptance by all parties that the two-Korea situation is permanent, and the border can be de-militarized once and for all. 
</p>
<p>
There has been some movement toward reconciliation. For example, the two Koreas sometimes field joint sports teams for international competitions, under the name Unified Korea. Negotiations still take place between the two sides, often with the assistance of four other interested parties: Russia, China, Japan, and the United States. Despite the highly militarized society of the North and the aggressive rhetoric of its leaders, there is hope for a peaceful resolution.
</p>

<h5>2.5.12.3. Taiwan</h5>

<p>
Taiwan is an island country in the southern Pacific that fell into American hands at the end of World War II. It had been a Japanese possession prior to that, and was "on the Japanese side" in the war, at least nominally. But China lay claim to Taiwan, calling it a natural and historical part of China, named Taipei province. The true history is more complicated than that; the island has been dominated by a variety of foreign powers, changing hands over the years. The indigenous population is all but extinct.
</p>
<p>
As of 2022, China asks other countries to adopt the "one China policy" and to treat Taiwan in many respects as a province of China, and not as an independent country. China refers to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei." China does not recognize Taiwanese passports, and issues special travel permits for people who want to travel to mainland China. There are other special rules and procedures designed to allow a certain degree of autonomy to Taiwan while reiterating the one-China policy. 
</p>
<p>
The people of Taiwan are divided on the issue. About one-third want to be part of China; one-third want to be an independent country; and one-third are happy with the current status. During the communist revolution in China, leaders of the deposed government fled to Taiwan, where they established a government in exile under the name, Republic of China. But they never formally declared independence and have not been recognized by the rest of the world as a separate nation-state. This may be because they hoped to return to China to take control of the whole country. Things did not work out in their favor over time.
</p>
<p>
Taiwan is an interesting special case for the State, as one of our most important policies for international relations is to build a strong partnership with China. The US has been an ally of Taiwan, along with South Korea, Japan, and Australia (among others) - all these are principal trade partners for America. Therefore, we must tread carefully. 
</p>
<p>
The <em>status quo</em> is functional for China and for Taiwan, and could be maintained indefinitely. There are advantages for China in that Taiwan's unique position opens doors for trade, innovation, and development that would be difficult if the island were fully integrated into the Chinese political/economic system. 
</p>
<p>
Another peaceful solution may be for Taiwan to gradually assimilate into China. As the population ages and new generations arise, interest in the Republic of China is fading away. Younger people may see advantages in being part of a larger, powerful country. 
</p>
<p>
The State has no official position on which solution is best in the long run. We will support any solution that can be achieved peacefully, without destabilizing the Pacific region, and that meets the needs of all interested parties. 
</p>

<h5>2.5.12.4. Texas</h5>

<p>
By default, the State will consider all the territory of the present-day US as the territory of America, with the exception of the state of Texas. The State intends to assist Texas in becoming established as an independent country. We anticipate Texas will be of great importance to America as (a) a principal trade partner, (b) an immediate neighbor, and (c) a part of the American "neighborhood."
</p>
<p>
However, legislation and rhetoric in Texas in recent years demonstrates to our satisfaction that the fundamental values of Texans are at odds with those of Americans. There will be less friction if the two countries engage on the level of international relations than if America tries to incorporate Texans into a society so very different from their own. Texans would then be free to institute whatever laws they please without having to justify them in terms of human rights. 
</p>

<h5>2.5.12.5. Russia</h5>

<p>
The Russian self-concept that it is not "just" another country, but rather a <em>civilization</em>, on the same level as East Asian civilization, South Asian civilization, or Western civilization, makes it impossible to establish fully open relations. They desire to dominate the world under their own terms. As a result, they cannot function as a co-equal partner with any other country.
</p>
<p>
Russia will work with others when matters of mutual interest are in play, but in the long term Russia cannot be trusted. Sooner or later, they always reassert themselves as a global power, sometimes aspirationally and sometimes in fact. We need relations with Russia to prevent their slipping into Category 9, yet we cannot afford to get too close. Realistically, Category 6 is the best result we are likely to achieve.
</p>

<h3>2.6. War As the Last Resort</h3>

<p>
We recognize that war creates significant cost for all participants and can set back the economies of participating countries by decades, including the "winners." In keeping with our emphasis on <em>stability</em> as the foundation for peace and prosperity, we prefer to avoid "full-scale" war except when a hostile foreign power insists upon it. We may, however, use limited military force in the effort to maintain international stability and as needed to defend the Three Pillars of Independence.
</p>
<p>
The phrase "last resort" is usually understood to mean "unthinkable." Our use of the phrase rests on the word, <em>last</em>, as in "final" - there is nothing afterward. Should a hostile foreign power refuse every reasonable attempt to resolve conflict short of war, then the State's policy will be to ensure the war is the last, the <em>final</em>, act of that hostile power. 
</p>
<p>
We disagree with the thinking of Carl von Clausewitz that "war is...the continuation of politics by different means." In our view, international relations (including conflict resolution) are best handled with stability and mutual benefit in mind. When a situation devolves into war, it is necessary to eliminate the threat permanently and restore stability. War is not "merely" another way to advance the policies of a nation. It is entirely unnecessary in a civilized world. Unfortunately, that word does not describe the world of 2022.
</p>


<a name="treaties"/>
<h2>3. Treaties and Memberships</h2>

<p>
The State will enter into treaties and join international organizations just as every other government does. The fact the State completely replaces the US government means that America will not automatically inherit treaty agreements and international memberships from the US. We will have to renegotiate treaties (e.g., the Paris Agreement on climate change, the New START nuclear weapons agreement with Russia) and re-apply for membership in international organizations (e.g., Organization of American States (OAS), United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)). 
</p>
<p>
Per the <a href="transition.html">Transition Plan</a>, the State will issue public declarations of intent to adhere to all treaties of the US until such time as each agreement can be renegotiated with the State as the signatory for America. The State will comply with the rules of organizations to which the US belonged with respect to changing the membership to the State or applying for new membership. 
</p>

<a name="territory"/>
<h2>4. The Physical Territory of America</h2>

<p>
	Eventually, the physical territory of America may differ from that of the present-day US. As a starting point, we define American territory as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>All US states as of the date of the <a href="tr-stages.html">Public Approval Stage</a> of the <a href="transition.html">Transition Plan</a>, except Texas.</li>
		<li>The District of Columbia</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	US states have a mixed history. Some were founding members of the United States. Some joined by free choice. Others were purchased from colonial countries that had conquered and occupied them. A few were taken by military force. We do not intend to sift through history and attempt to right all past wrongs. The present-day states except as noted above will be taken as the default, initial territory of America. 
</p>
<p>
	Texas is omitted because of the political situation there in the 2020s, and the cultural trend toward extremism, theocracy, and devaluation of human rights. We do not consider it feasible to incorporate Texan culture into American culture, due to profound and irreconcilable differences in fundamental values. Therefore, we will help Texas become established as an independent country, and work with Texans on the basis of international relations. We will get along better as neighbors than as roommates.
</p>
<p>
	With regard to US territories, the State treats them differently based on whether they have permanent civilian populations.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Organized territories and American Samoa - the residents will choose whether to become part of the new America or to become independent countries. The organized territories are those that have permanent, non-military populations. They include Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition to these, American Samoa has a permanent civilian population, but is not "organized" according to the US Constitution. Because it has a permanent civilian population, the State considers it in this group.</li>
		<li>Unorganized territories have no permanent civilian populations. Initially, they will remain under American control as military bases. These include Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Wake Island, and Navassa Island.</li>
		<li>The US science stations in Antarctica will continue to be managed by the State. As this is written, the active stations are McMurdo Station, Palmer Station, Lenie, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole. Several others are in a "closed" status, and some are listed as "abandoned."</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	After the <a href="tr-stages.html">Closing Stage</a> of the transition, the State will accept petitions from territories within America whose people wish to separate from America, and petitions from territories outside America whose people wish to become part of America. We will ask that people refrain from requesting these changes until after the new system has had a chance to settle in for a few years.
