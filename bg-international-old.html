<h2>1. Principles</h2>

<p>
These are the principles on which our foreign policy is based.
</p>

<a name="pillars"/>
<h3>1.1. No Compromise On the Three Pillars of Independence</h3>

<p>
The <a href="bg-three-pillars.html">Three Pillars of Independence</a> are the foundation and framework for Americans' freedom. Without them, we have nothing. Therefore, the State will sign no international agreement and will tolerate no action by a foreign actor that would undermine the Three Pillars of Independence. 
</p>

<a name="jurisdiction"/>
<h3>1.2. Our State Is for Our People</h3>

<p>
America is not the policeman of the world, the judge and jury for other countries, or the defender of human rights for anyone other than Americans. The State will not demand that any foreign government adjust its internal policies as a condition of entering into agreements with America. By the same token, the State will not tolerate any interference in our own internal affairs. The State will also take an interest in the stability and security of our "neighborhood" - the Americas.
</p>

<a name="approach"/>
<h2>2. Approach</h2>

<p>
These are general guidelines for the State's approach to international relations.
</p>

<a name="relationships"/>
<h3>2.1. Relationships</h3>

<p>
Present-day US foreign policy consists of interventions in the domestic affairs of foreign countries, demands for support when the US needs support, economic pressure on foreign governments to force them to do what the US wants, and overt or covert military operations to forcibly change governments when it is convenient for the US. When a situation emerges in which the US wants a particular outcome, diplomats must scurry around trying to wrangle support from various governments because the US has not already established positive working relationships with those governments. US diplomats only knock on the door when they need something, and by then the problem is urgent and there is no time to build relationships.
</p>
<p>
Not to make light of it, but the US is much like Gandalf in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. He only showed up when there was trouble, so people associated his arrival with trouble. Even when the US has good intentions, and even when US assistance would be of great value to others, people naturally associate the country with trouble because the Americans only show up when there is trouble.
</p>
<p>
The State's approach will be to build positive working relationships with as many governments as possible, regardless of whether America "needs" the help or support of those governments in the moment. We are always engaged in a constructive way. The intent is that when unexpected problems arise, many governments will be ready to offer support naturally, because of the ongoing positive relationship with the State. 
</p>
<p>
This means engaging with governments whose policies are distasteful to us. The key point to remember is they are not us. The form of government, human rights records, and propaganda of those governments are irrelevant. Only the Three Pillars of Independence are relevant (to us). 
</p>
<p>
Many Americans will recoil at the thought of doing business with a foreign country that engages in human rights abuses within their own territory. The advantage of our approach to foreign policy is that when America is fully independent, Americans can freely make the choice not to do business with such countries. As long as there are any dependencies on the country in question, Americans are not free to step away from engagement. 
</p>
<p>
Due to the economic strength of America, it will be in other countries' best interests to engage with us. Therefore, in a roundabout way, our hands-off policy may influence other governments to refrain from human rights abuses. The State will not attempt to influence other countries' human rights abuses from a moralistic position. Our influence will be in the nature of <em>soft power</em> - because it will be desirable for others to engage with us, they may choose to adjust their domestic policies such that Americans wish to engage with them. Should they choose not to do so, their decision can do America no harm.
</p>

<a name="stability"/>
<h3>2.2. Seek Stability First, Then Peace</h3>

<p>
We observe national governments that seek peace "at all costs" often give way to bullies and tyrants in the hope they can avoid war. The problem is the phrase, "at all costs." When facing a belligerent and ambitious foreign power, "all costs" may be too much to pay for the illusion of "peace."
</p>
<p>
We further observe governments that focus on the <em>stability</em> of the global order and of bilateral relationships enjoy more peace and prosperity than those that simply avoid conflict at any cost. The formula for peace is: 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	Stability + Trade = Peace
</p>
<p>
The State will focus on stability first, using peaceful or forceful methods as necessary to ensure stability. Stability is the foundation for genuine and lasting peace. There will be times when an aggressor disrupts the system and introduces instability, and they must be dealt with. We prefer peace, but we must remain cognizant of the costs and make choices that yield the maximum benefit and/or minimum harm, in keeping with utilitarian ethics. Peace as such is not the foundation of our foreign policy; it is an outcome, arising naturally from stability and trade.
</p>

<a name="neutrality"/>
<h3>2.3. Default Position of Neutrality</h3>

<p>
In any given situation when international tension arises, the State will confer with all governments with which we have positive working relationships and seek collaborative approaches to restore stability. We will not rush to "choose sides" in the conflict. 
</p>
<p>
We observe <em>stability</em> is often better served when powerful states take a neutral position than when they back one side or the other. However, this is not a hard-and-fast rule to be followed mindlessly. Maintaining the Three Pillars of Independence is always our primary goal in international relations. Should we determine that choosing a side will serve our national interests better than maintaining neutrality, then we will choose that side. 
</p>
<p>
We observe and expect that most international conflicts can be resolved without recourse to war if the more-powerful players remain calm and demonstrate steady, consistent leadership. However, there are times when an aggressor <em>insists</em> on war. When that happens, we intend to be in an overwhelmingly dominant position.
</p>

<a name="econpower"/>
<h3>2.4. Use Economic Power Generously</h3>

<p>
	As the preeminent economic power in the world, America can afford to be generous with funding development programs and helping other countries in need as a way to build positive working relationships and encourage a willingness to cooperate in future, when we may need their support.
</p>
<p>
	This also helps to maintain the stability of the global order by building the security and prosperity of as many countries as possible. This approach also enables greater prosperity, as countries that are stable, prosperous, and secure make better business partners, customers, and suppliers than countries that are "held down" as a way to make them dependent.
</p>
<p>
	The State's policy to make use of America's economic strength is driven, in part, by demographic trends. As the boomer generation moves out of the workforce and is replaced by gen-X, which is a much smaller cohort, America will have difficulty supporting social services. There will be more people drawing benefits than there are contributing to the system. Eventually, gen-X will retire and gen-Y will reach its maximum earning capacity. Gen-Y is another large cohort, almost as large as the boomers. But in the interim, when gen-X is the primary engine of wealth-generation, there will be economic challenges.
</p>
<p>
	Most analysts today (mid-2022) agree that all developed countries are facing a gradual decline in population, and will probably face extended periods of economic recession in the coming decades. But they tend to look only at the usual suspects - western Europe, Japan and South Korea, and the anglophone countries. Most analyses never mention Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, or Africa at all. Yet, many countries in those regions have younger populations than the "developed" world.
</p>
<p>
	 The State will pay due attention to these regions, and use America's economic strength to help them develop into stable and prosperous trade partners. During gen-X's ascendancy, we can bolster America's economy through trade with these emerging economies. That approach represents a radical departure from US foreign policy. It marks the end of the Bretton Woods era, bringing new economic partners to the fore. 
</p>

<a name="ring"/>
<h3>2.5. Categories of Nation-States</h3>

<p>
The State emphasizes relationships with nation-states that are important for the sustainable independence of America. Sustainable independence is the foundation for Americans' freedom. This is more important than alignment with foreign governments that share similar political systems or with foreign cultures that share basic values. 
</p>
<p>
It is possible to group nation-states into various categories as a way to consider how to approach relations, at least at a high level. There will be special cases that cross the boundaries between catagories, or that belong to two conflicting categories simultaneously.

<h2>3. Treaties and Memberships</h2>

<p>
The State will enter into treaties and join international organizations just as every other government does. The fact the State completely replaces the US government means that America will not automatically inherit treaty agreements and international memberships from the US. We will have to renegotiate treaties (e.g., the Paris Agreement on climate change, the New START nuclear weapons agreement with Russia) and re-apply for membership in international organizations (e.g., Organization of American States (OAS), United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)). 
</p>
<p>
Per the <a href="transition.html">Transition Plan</a>, the State will issue public declarations of intent to adhere to all treaties of the US until such time as each agreement can be renegotiated with the State as the signatory for America. The State will comply with the rules of organizations to which the US belonged with respect to changing the membership to the State or applying for new membership. 
</p>

<a name="territory"/>
<h2>4. The Physical Territory of America</h2>

<p>
	Eventually, the physical territory of America may differ from that of the present-day US. As a starting point, we define American territory as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>All US states as of the date of the <a href="tr-stages.html">Public Approval Stage</a> of the <a href="transition.html">Transition Plan</a>, except Texas.</li>
		<li>The District of Columbia</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	US states have a mixed history. Some were founding members of the United States. Some joined by free choice. Others were purchased from colonial countries that had conquered and occupied them. A few were taken by military force. We do not intend to sift through history and attempt to right all past wrongs. The present-day states except as noted above will be taken as the default, initial territory of America. 
</p>
<p>
	With regard to US territories, the State treats them differently based on whether they have permanent civilian populations.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Organized territories and American Samoa - the residents will choose whether to become part of the new America or to become independent countries. The organized territories are those that have permanent, non-military populations. They include Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition to these, American Samoa has a permanent civilian population, but is not "organized" according to the US Constitution. Because it has a permanent civilian population, the State considers it in this group.</li>
		<li>Unorganized territories have no permanent civilian populations. Initially, they will remain under American control as military bases. These include Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Wake Island, and Navassa Island.</li>
		<li>The US science stations in Antarctica will continue to be managed by the State. As this is written, the active stations are McMurdo Station, Palmer Station, Lenie, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole. Several others are in a "closed" status, and some are listed as "abandoned."</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	After the <a href="tr-stages.html">Closing Stage</a> of the transition, the State will accept petitions from territories within America whose people wish to separate from America, and petitions from territories outside America whose people wish to become part of America. We will ask that people refrain from requesting these changes until after the new system has had a chance to settle in for a few years.
</p>
<p>
	There is one territory we are interested in having as part of America, and many who live there have expressed the desire or willingness to shift into America formally. Their existing laws already allow for this. We will refrain from mentioning the name at this time. It is a region that would more than compensate for the loss of Texas, as far as natural resources and general economic value are concerned. In addition, the regional culture is more compatible with American values than is Texan culture.

<h2>5. Short-Term Priorities</h2>

<p>
In the 2020s, we are living through a time of volatility. Nation-states and alliances are too unstable to enable us to craft detailed policies for engagement with any given country or region beyond our own neighborhood. Yet, there are a few major issues that will require the immediate attention of the State.
</p>

<a name="Texas"/>
<h3>5.1. Texas Transition to Independence</h3>

<p>
	Throughout the 2010s and 2020s, Texas has passed legislation, taken actions against people, and its elected leaders have expressed views about human rights and human dignity that convince us their fundamental values are at odds with those of the American people generally. The gleeful cruelty of their words and actions has steadily grown more severe throughout that period. Our conclusion is that America and Texas can get along better as neighbors than as roommates. 
</p>
<p>
	The transition from the US to the State will require time. The aspect that is likely to take the most time is the change in the public educational system. We anticipate a transition period of between 15 and 17 years for those changes to become established. Most other changes can be accomplished comfortably within that time frame. The shift for Texas from US statehood to independence can be completed smoothly and peacefully within that time frame. It need not extend for decades. However, the transition has to begin immediately, as there is a great deal to be done. 
</p>
<p>
	This allows ample time for Texas' leaders to establish connections with other national governments so they can begin to build independent international relationships, to set up the infrastructure and administrative apparatus they will need to operate independently, and to return or pay for national assets owned by the American people that are located within Texas' borders. During the same time period, individual Americans who are philosophically aligned with Texan values can relocate their homes and businesses there. This opportunity will be especially helpful for residents of Florida, another US state whose fundamental values are questionable, to relocate to Texas before most of Florida goes underwater due to climate change. Conversely, residents of Texas who are philosophically aligned with American values can relocate to wherever they wish within American territory.
</p>
<p>
	Once Texas is operating fully independently, it will be an important neighbor to America, and a welcome trade partner. As such, Texas will be eligible for significant economic assistance from America. Our general policy to engage with other countries without criticizing their internal human rights records will play in Texas' favor. They will be free to treat minorities, women, and children however they please; to ban books and limit freedom of speech; and to craft school curricula that teach a false history, all without damaging the rest of America, and without any interference <em>from</em> America. It is a win-win solution.
</p>
<p>
	Texas will also bear the sole non-negotiable responsibility we expect from all our neighbors: They must not allow hostile foreign actors to use their territory as a base for any actions that might undermine the Three Pillars of Independence. As the Texans themselves might say: That is a conversation they don't want to have.
</p>

<h3>5.2. Stabilization of the Neighborhood (the Americas)</h3>

<p>
	It is no great pleasure to live in a fine house that is situated in the middle of a deteriorated and dangerous neighborhood. Maintenance of the house and grounds and ensuring security are more expensive than would be the case were the house located in a stable, prosperous, safe neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
	This is the reason the State will seek to stabilize the "neighborhood" surrounding America. We are willing to invest heavily in this effort, so that every country in the Americas can be stable, prosperous, and safe. 
</p>
<p>
	The benefits of stabilizing the neighborhood touch on several areas of concern. Perhaps most obviously, it would end the flow of refugees and asylum-seekers from Central America. When their home countries are stable and safe, and they can find economic opportunity there without worrying about violence by criminal gangs, people will not be keen to emigrate. 
</p>
<p>
	Secondly, stabilization implies eliminating the criminal cartels that presently engage in trafficking of people, antiquities, drugs, weapons, and so forth. 
</p>
<p>
	Thirdly, stabilization will mean influencing those national governments that are friendly toward hostile foreign powers that can undermine the Three Pillars of Independence if they are permitted to establish a foothold in the Americas.
</p>
<p>
	We believe these three goals are interrelated; addressing any one of them will necessarily mean addressing two or more of them together. For example, unstable regimes provide safe havens for the criminal cartels; the criminal cartels create untenable conditions for ordinary people; ordinary people flee the untenable conditions in their home countries. 
</p>
<p>
	We cannot accomplish this alone. We must first build positive working relationships with regional governments. Based on those relationships, we must then reach formal agreement with certain regional governments to collaborate closely in the elimination of criminal cartels. This will require time and sustained diplomatic effort. 
</p>
<p>
	We believe Canada will be willing to cooperate in the stabilization program, particularly in the effort to eliminate the criminal cartels.
</p>
<p>
	We anticipate it will be easiest to gain agreement with Mexico, as that country experiences the negative effects of both the criminal cartels and mass migration from Central America, just as the present-day US does. 
</p>
<p>
	It may be more challenging to reach agreement with Texas due to the inevitable friction that will exist between us in the wake of our "dis-inviting" them from America. Yet, it is in their best interest to solve the regional problems. 
</p>
<p>
	Colombia may be another challenge, as their government has come to terms with the cartels and with FARC as a way to halt violence in their country. Their leaders may be too closely entwined with the cartels and FARC for them to shift allegiance without considerable persuasion.
</p>
<p>
	Beyond that, Cuba and Venezuela have evolved into a sort of "axis of brutality" since the Chavez era. Currently, they actively support the cartels in handling drug shipments. It may be necessary to take heavy-handed, direct action to stabilize those countries. However, we will first attempt diplomatic methods. 
</p>
<p>
	When they begin to understand the inevitable outcome of our stabilization program, cartel leaders will seek safe havens in nearby countries. It will be necessary to discourage Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama from offering safe havens. We can use generous economic support to encourage the desired behavior from those governments.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, we must engage with the "good actors" within Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador and help them establish stable governments that have no ties to the criminal cartels. We will also need their assistance to locate and eradicate gang strongholds in those countries, as that is where most of the cartel members come from. 
</p>
<p>
	It is a complicated problem that will involve both logistical challenges in execution and diplomatic challenges in building and maintaining the coalition.
</p>
<p>
	The larger and longer-term stabilization policy involves more than this immediate regional problem. We would like to see every country in the Americas become as strong and successful as possible, given their resources and potential. This will require steady and dependable economic partnership with each country.

<h3>5.3. Concluding the Korean Conflict</h3>

<p>
	The Korean Conflict began in 1950 and a cease-fire was reached in 1953. The cease-fire has been in effect since then. The conflict has never formally ended. Korea remains a flash point for military escalation. As such, the situation is destabilizing for the Pacific region. North Korea repeatedly threatens South Korea, Japan, and the US, leading to multinational war games involving supporters of the North on the one hand and supporters of the South on the other. Any more localized dispute, such as the status of Taiwan, can easily escalate beyond the level that is strictly necessary, should North Korea take the opportunity to strike while tensions are high. 
</p>
<p>
	The conflict began as a proxy war between the US and USSR during their 20th-century Cold War. The Cold War ended before most of the present population of the world was born; few people today remember it and still fewer care about it. With the advent of the State, and the establishment of modern Russia after 1989, neither the US nor the USSR - the original antagonists in the conflict - still exists. It is illogical for hostilities between North and South Korea to continue.
</p>
<p>
	Although the division of Korea was precipitated by outside actors and was not a choice of the Korean people, the two parts have operated separately for such a long time that reconciliation and reunification seem very unlikely. The two Koreas have taken very different paths in their development. As this is written, they are so utterly different on a cultural level that it seems more feasible to keep them as two distinct countries. However, the hostilities and the militarization of the 38th parallel can be brought to an end through diplomatic effort. The fact Korea has divided into two Koreas does not necessitate a hostile relationship. The people of Korea may need support from friends to reach that conclusion.
