<h1>Backgrounder on the Age of Majority</h1>

<p>
The <em>age of majority</em> is the age at which an individual is considered to be an adult for legal purposes, such as signing a contract, joining the military, or casting votes in elections.

<h2>1. The Age of Majority in the US and Elsewhere</h2>
<p>
One consideration for determining an appropriate age to declare an individual an "adult" is to check the age of majority in the present-day US and in other countries. 
</p>

<a name="agesus"/>
<h3>1.1. Minimum Ages in the US</h3>
<p>
The first thing we notice when we check into US law is that there are different ages for different adult activities.
</p>
<p>
At first glance this seems needlessly complicated, but there is a rationale for it. Humans develop gradually, and achieve a reasonable ability to handle different things at different ages. Let us consider whether these differences are sufficient to warrant complicated rules about when a person can be treated as an adult for legal purposes.
</p>
<p>
A summary of "adult" ages in the US:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>0 - minimum age to marry with parental consent in California and Mississippi</li>
		<li>12 - minimum age to marry with parental consent in Massachussetts</li>
		<li>13 - minimum age to marry with parental consent in New Hampshire</li>
		<li>14 - age of consent for sex under the "close in age" exemption in Florida</li>
		<li>15 - minimum age to marry with parental consent in Hawaii and Missouri</li>
		<li>15 - learner's permit to drive a vehicle</li>
		<li>16 - minimum age to marry with parental consent in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming</li>
		<li>16 - license to drive a vehicle</li>
		<li>17 - minimum age to marry with parental consent in Indiana, Nebraska, Oregon, and Washington</li>
		<li>17 - can join the military with written parental consent</li>
		<li>17 - can vote in a primary election if 18th birthday is before the general election in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.</li>
		<li>17 - age of consent for sex in Texas</li>
		<li>18 - minimum age to vote, except as stipulated above for primary elections</li>
		<li>18 - minimum age to purchase firearms</li>
		<li>18 - can join the military (there are also maximum enlistment ages by branch)</li>
		<li>18 - minimum age to marry without parental consent in all states except Nebraska</li>
		<li>18 - age of consent for sex in all states except Texas</li>
		<li>19 - minimum age to marry without parental consent in Nebraska</li>
		<li>21 - minimum age to purchase and consume alcohol</li>
		<li>25 - can run for the House of Representatives</li>
		<li>27 - minimum age when one must purchase one's own car insurance and not be covered by parents' policy - locale and company rules may stipulate a lower age, typically 25</li>
		<li>30 - can run for the US Senate</li>
		<li>35 - can run for President</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
So, the present-day US defines 14 different minimum ages for 23 different activities. That brings us back to our initial impression that the rules are needlessly complicated. But let's continue.
</p>
<p>
Nine of these age thresholds and 11 of the controlled activities pertain to sex or marriage, suggesting Americans are preoccupied with sex. Based on the way sexual behavior is represented in American mass entertainment, the way Americans react to sexual innuendo and humor, the popularity of pornography with a strong sense of "forbidden fruit," and religion-based laws and customs surrounding intimate relations, it seems clear that Americans are, indeed, preoccupied with this subject to a far greater extent than any other subject. We suspect this is a cultural artifact of early English settlers' Puritanism. Strangely, in almost all parts of the US, Americans can legally marry before they can legally have sex. This must be a source of some frustration for young newlyweds.
</p>

<a name="culture"/>
<h3>1.2. Cultural Differences Within America</h3>

<p>
Muslims and Fundamentalist Christians allow marriage between older men and very young girls. Support for the custom comes from Surah Talaq Ayat 4 (65:4 Quran) and from the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy in the Old Testament of the Bible. In both cases, the rule is not based on age, but on whether the girl has started to have periods. 
</p>
<p>
That stage of development is significant in other cultures, as well. Jews celebrate an adulthood ritual called the <em>bar mitzvah</em> (for boys) and the <em>bat mitzvah</em> for girls, after which the individual bears the responsibilities of an adult member of the faith. The Din&eacute; (Navajo) celebrate a puberty ceremony for girls called <em>Kinaald&aacute;</em> on the fourth night after their first period. It marks a significant change from childhood to adulthood, with a corresponding change in expectations and responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
Many cultures treat puberty as a crossing-over from childhood to adulthood. In ancient times this may have occurred from age 14 to 16, and with life expectancy commonly in the range of 30 to 40 it made sense for people to begin their adult lives as early as possible. But in modern times puberty often occurs between ages 11 and 13. Is this age really appropriate for a citizen of a modern nation-state to assume the full burden of adulthood? 
</p>
<p>
The State is not based on religious beliefs and is not a copy of anyone's cultural traditions. It must be based on the most objective assessment we can manage of what is "good" for the largest number of Americans. We must consider what is expected of an adult citizen, and at what age Americans can be expected to handle those duties.
</p>

<h3>1.3. Age of Consent Around the World</h3>
<p>
As the age of consent for sex appears to be of deep interest to lawmakers, we decided to check into the age of consent in other countries, as well. On the website <a href="https://www.ageofconsent.net/world">https://www.ageofconsent.net/world</a> we found a list of countries with the age of consent for each. We will not list them all here in the interest of space. Here is a summary of the number of countries that specify the age of consent, ranging from ages 11 to 20. 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>11 - 1 country (Nigeria)</li>
		<li>12 - 2 countries</li>
		<li>13 - 5 countries</li>
		<li>14 - 32 countries</li>
		<li>15 - 25 countries</li>
		<li>16 - 76 countries</li>
		<li>17 - 4 countries</li>
		<li>18 - 40 countries (the US is in this group)</li>
		<li>19 - 1 country</li>
		<li>20 - 1 country (South Korea)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
If we eliminate the outliers, we see the general range considered normal for the age of consent is from 14 to 18 years old, with the most countries by far pegging the age at 16. The age of 16 is common enough to be considered a global consensus.
</p>


<a name="behavior"/>
<h2>2. Observations of Americans' Behavior</h2>
<p>
We have mentioned that the rationale usually offered for specifying different minimum ages for different activities is that humans develop gradually, and do not abruptly change from child to adult. That sounds reasonable to us. Consistent with our practical approach, we reviewed our observations of "typical" American behavior patterns at different ages to see if Americans change in a significant way as they grow older. If so, then there may be value in setting different minimum ages for different activities. If not, then there is no obvious value in complicating the law - a single age of majority will suffice for the State. 
</p>
<p>
Human development seems to progress rapidly in the early stages of life, and then slows as the individual ages. Development never ceases, but there may be an age at which a human more-or-less "stabilizes" in an adult form, and continues in the same manner for most of their remaining lifespan.
</p>
<p>
Our observation is that humans change significantly within short time spans during the early part of their lives. The change from the implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine wall until birth is tremendous. The change in the first year after birth is very significant. Changes continue rapidly until around age 7 or 8. The brain continues to develop and the body grows. The individual changes appreciably between ages 8 and 10, 10 and 12, 12 and 14, 14 and 16.
</p>
<p>
Still more development remains after age 16, but at this stage development is slower, and a 16 year old is basically fully functional. Of course, many Americans continue to learn, grow, and change throughout their lives. But if we are considering basic rules to cover the majority of cases, we must examine the typical behavior patterns of "average" Americans. 
</p>
<p>
For the most part, Americans behave the same way throughout their adult lives. From age 16 until old age, they do not change except to age physically. 
</p>
<p>
The average American at age 16 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>drinks alcohol;</li>
		<li>has sex or masturbates;</li>
		<li>watches sports on television; and </li>
		<li>does not consider how their actions might affect others or what consequences might come back to them.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The average American at age 26 is the same.
</p>
<p>
The average American at age 36 is the same.
</p>
<p>
The average American at age 46 is the same.
</p>
<p>
The average American at age 56 is the same.
</p>
<p>
The average American at age 66 is the same.
</p>
<p>
We are compelled to ask, what is the value of setting different age thresholds for different activities? If the average American is whoever they will forever be by the age of 16, it would be simpler to peg the age of majority at 16, for all activities.
</p>


<a name="majority"/>
<h2>3. The Age of Majority in the State</h2>
<p>
Based on these observations and on this reasoning, we establish the age of majority at 16. From their 16th birthday forward, Americans will be expected to function as adults, and will be held accountable for their actions as adults. They are free to do as they please within the law.
</p>

<a name="adjustments"/>
<h2>4. Reasonable Adjustments</h2>
<p>
Even if the age of majority for general purposes is 16, there may be circumstances in which some reasonable adjustment can be made to the age at which certain activities are legal.
</p>
<p>
These adjustments would typically be defined at the level of <em>regulations</em>, and in some cases at the level of <em>statutory law</em>, and are out of scope for a Backgrounder. However, some examples may include:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Service in national-level governmental organizations may set requirements that effectively raise the minimum age at which an individual will qualify; for example, to serve on the National Advisory Board one must have completed a university degree and demonstrate a professional "track record" of a few years' length. That requirement effectively raises the minimum age of a Board member to approximately their mid-twenties, when they are more mature than they were at 16.</li>
		<li>Laws in the present-day US system known as "similar age" or "Romeo and Juliet" laws make exceptions to "technical" rape when the two parties are of similar age and/or began their relationship before the elder of the two reached the age of majority. Similar laws may be passed under the State system. At the time of writing, Florida has such a law and defines the age range as 4 years. Florida defines the age of consent as 18; the State defines the age of consent at 16, when people are less mature; therefore, the age range may be smaller, such as 2 years.</li>
		<li>For certain dangerous items, notably firearms, the regulations for licensure may call for background screening of a nature that effectively makes it very difficult for immature individuals to obtain firearms, age notwithstanding. This does not violate anyone's rights as of the age of majority, as it is not based on age but rather on characteristics determined in the background check. It is possible one individual aged 16 would pass the checks while another aged 35 would fail. Some of the mass shooters in the US have been over 60 years old at the time of their crimes; this suggests an age limit is not a viable solution, and a focus on other factors is advisable.</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<a name="feedback"/>
<h2>5. Considerations from Feedback</h2>
<p>
	Constructive feedback from discussions of these ideas has resulted in some refinement of these ideas.
</p>

<a name="fbconsent"/>
<h3>5.1. Age of Consent for Sex</h3>

<p>
	We find it interesting that almost all the feedback we have received on the subject of the age of majority concerns the age of consent for sex. It seems to be a major preoccupation for most Americans, far out of proportion to any other topic related to age. The emphasis on the age of consent in feedback is consistent with the intensity of public discussion on the subject, and the large number of US state laws pertaining to sex - not only the age of consent, but in many cases the specific sexual activities that are permitted by law, and even who is allowed to have intimate relations with whom. It is an odd juxtaposition with the fact Americans do not want the government involved in their personal lives in any <em>other</em> context. We speculate this may reflect the Puritan background of the early English colonists in North America.
</p>
<p>
	In discussing our thoughts about the age of consent for sex, we found many people worry that a 16-year-old is not mature enough to handle an intense personal relationship, and that individuals below the age of 21 are susceptible to manipulation by older people who may exploit them. Our observations of Americans' general behavior does not suggest they mature very much - if at all - after they pass the age of 16. If Americans wanted observers like us to see that they mature beyond age 16, then they should have behaved accordingly over the past decades and centuries; but they simply do not behave in a way that suggests they grow in maturity with age. 
</p>
<p>
	It has been pointed out to us that humans continue to develop physiologically beyond the age of 16. Even so, it is clear to us that some individuals who are still below 20 years of age are quite mature, while others continue to think and behave as adolescents well into old age. (See the <a href="bg-american-characteristics.html">Backgrounder on the Characteristics of Americans</a> for more on that subject.) Therefore, we resist the idea of setting age limits, including relative age ranges, for couples. In keeping with the philosophy that there is no offense unless someone is offended (and by "someone" we don't mean a third party who is philosohically opposed to what the primary parties are doing), we must acknowledge that some couples will have significant age differences. 
</p>
<p>
	We must also recognize the fact that there is no age at which a person ceases to be susceptible to manipulation; that seems to be a factor not entirely controlled by age, even if it is <em>influenced</em> by age. Statistically, 16-year-olds on the whole may be more susceptible than 46-year-olds, but any given individual 16-year-old may not have that problem. Meanwhile, a person in their 30s or 40s can easily be a victim of manipulation, exploitation, and scams. Indeed, the elderly seem to be a population that is particularly affected by scams. Their age does not protect them. So we take the position that if someone complains that they have been exploited, law enforcement will investigate the situation on the merits. What matters is whether harm has been done, and if so, then the extent of the harm. The ages of the participants is not the factor that determines whether a crime has been committed.
</p>
<p>
	Some have expressed the concern that younger women/girls are not fully developed, and cannot carry a pregnancy safely to term. While this observation is medically correct, it does not change the general behavior of young people, and does not make it the State's responsibility to monitor everyone's behavior at that level of detail. Parents, extended families, faith communities, teachers, and other responsible adults have influence in young people's lives, and apart from the content of the core educational curriculum, responsibility for other aspects of the development of young people under their care falls to them, not to the State. 
</p>
<p>
	Abusers and exploiters are often members of the adult communities responsible for raising young people - their own families, clergy, teachers, and other authority figures. An aspect of American culture is that children are raised to respect and obey adult authority figures. Like anything else, this can be taken beyond the point of diminishing returns. The result can be that the young person does not feel comfortable speaking up about abuse or exploitation, for fear of being punished for showing a lack of respect or obedience to an authority figure. This is a cultural failing, and not a matter for State law. It is possible that aspects of the core educational curriculum will influence positive cultural change in this area, as there is an emphasis on thinking about whether an action causes harm to someone else, and on "doing the right thing" as opposed to blind, automatic obedience.  Time will tell.
