<h1>Backgrounder on Bread and Circuses</h1>

<p>
This is the same concept as Juvenal wrote about in ancient Roman times. The idea is that as long as the people have what they need for life and they are entertained, they will tend not to rise up and cause trouble out of frustration or boredom. The cost of providing bread and circuses to the general population is lower than the cost of dealing with the aftereffects of crime.
</p>
<p>
What is "bread?" Basically, <em>bread</em> includes the <em>deficiency needs</em> of humans, as described in the <a href="bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a>. Some forms of "bread" are denounced as entitlements or gifts or unearned benefits by present-day Americans who do not recognize the importance of overall social stability for maintaining their own personal liberty. We see "bread" as an investment in the order and stability of the society, far cheaper than dealing with unrest and boredom through law enforcement after the fact, and repairing whatever people break.
</p>
<p>
What are "circuses?" They are any and all forms of entertainment. Of particular importance are entertainments that enable people to cheer for one side or the other without doing any harm, such as sports contests, celebrity gossip, and the like. 
</p> 
<p>
But not every possible form of entertainment is harmless. We consider freedom of speech important, but we do not think the freedom to speak implies freedom from the natural consequences of what one chooses to say. For example, you can slander or libel someone, but you run the risk of a lawsuit. You can call a black person the N-word, but you run the risk of receiving a punch in the face. You can paint a swastika on your front door, but you run the risk of mob action in response. Even if the mob action is, itself, illegal, you still asked for it and there is no practical way to stop it before you have been harmed. See the <a href="bg-choice.html">Backgrounder on Choices and Consequences</a> for more on this line of thinking.
</p>
<p>
Words can lead to actions. And that brings us to another point.
</p>
<p>
As we reiterate time and again in these pages, any violation of human rights or legal rights, and any attempt to undermine the Three Pillars of Independence, will be considered a serious crime. On that basis, some of the things people say in the present-day US would be categorized as <em>stochastic terrorism</em> under the State system. They are intentional incitements to hatred and violence with the goal of destroying the country. These things are often masked as "entertainment" or "opinion," but they are more serious than that. 
</p>
<p>
The <em>circuses</em> in <em>bread and circuses</em> are meant to keep society stable, not to destabilize it.
