<h1>Backgrounder on Ethics</h1>

<p>
The <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/ethics-and-contrastivism/">Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> defines <em>ethics</em> as a branch of philosophy concerned with "systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior." What might be considered "right" or "wrong" may depend on a number of factors, including the belief system in play, the prevailing circumstances, the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the people involved, and the real or perceived consequences of choosing the "wrong" action. 
</p>
<p>
This political model defines a set of fundamental values. The values can be regarded as a belief system. It provides positive and negative motivations for people to help them choose "right" actions in the context of that belief system. It defines consequences for choosing "wrong" actions, in context. All this is guided by a particular branch or school of ethics, known as <em>Utilitarian Ethics</em>. That is a kind of <em>Normative Ethics</em> in the category of <em>Consequentialism</em>. 
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few different branches or schools of ethics, each of which defines "right" and "wrong" action differently. The basic idea of Utilitarian Ethics is that we want to choose an action that results in the maximum "good" and/or the minimum "bad" for some definition of "good" and "bad." For our purposes, the fundamental values of the system are the definition of "good."
</p>
<p>
The fundamental values touch on a number of different topics that are covered in multiple Backgrounders. The <a href="constitution.html">Constitution</a> provides a brief enumeration of the core values of the system. 
</p>
<p>
Many people who take an interest in philosophy are looking for universal, absolute truths. When they think about Utilitarian Ethics, they become stuck on the question of how to define absolute "good" or "bad" in a universal, unchanging way. They may conclude that Utilitarian Ethics is not useful, as it does not help them identify universal truths. They worry that the definition of "good" or "bad" will not hold in every conceivable context. 
</p>
<p>
To make sense of our concept of Utilitarian Ethics, you must keep in mind the <em>context</em>. We are <em>not</em> seeking universal, unchanging, absolute truths. We are seeking "to establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty without external interference." Things that move us toward that goal are "good" and everything else is "bad." It is not necessary to define "good" and "bad" in absolute, universal, immutable terms.
</p>
<p>
In straightforward questions of legal and illegal choices, there is little need to reason about the situation in terms of formal ethics. However, real life does not always present us with unambiguously "good" or "bad" options. We may have to determine the lesser of two evils. More happily, we may sometimes have to choose the better of two positive alternatives. By applying Utilitarian Ethics through the lens of our fundamental values, we can navigate these challenging situations in a way that is consistent with the underlying philosophy of the political model.
