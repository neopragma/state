<h1>Backgrounder on Simplification of Statutory Law</h1>

<p>
	In our review of federal and state legal codes in the present-day US, to identify statutes we want to carry forward and to see models of legal phrasing, we noticed that many statutes are redundant. There may be a separate statute under each title or chapter in a state legal code prohibiting bribery of officials who work in the particular department covered by that title or chapter; only a single statute prohibiting bribery is necessary. There may be multiple statutes prohibiting the sale of specific controlled substances to minors; only a single such statute is necessary. There may be multiple statutes prohibiting frivilous lawsuits, each one specified under a different heading in the same legal code; only a single such statute is necessary. There are numerous examples of this pattern. 
</p>
<p>
	We will endeavor to preserve the useful parts of existing statutory law without duplicating the unnecessary complexity of present-day legal codes.
