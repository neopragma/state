<h2>1. Problems</h2>

<p>
<em>Circa</em> 2022, the people of America (the "Americans") face a number of significant challenges. Arguably, these challenges, arising simultaneously, amount to an existential threat to the country and pose a risk to Americans' ability to live independently and with a high degree of individual liberty.
</p>
<p>
In many ways, the situation in the United States of the 2020s is reminiscent of the 1880s-1890s. The words of Ignacius Donnelly, in the Preamble to the People's Party platform of 1892, ring true for Americans today: "We meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political, and material ruin."
</p>
<p>
Here is George Washington quoting Thomas Jefferson (on the southeast wall of the Jefferson Memorial):
</p>
<p class="indent">
	"I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors."
</p>

<a name="identity"/>
<h3>1.1. Identity as Americans</h3>

<p>
Americans lack a shared sense of identity as citizens. Instead, most Americans feel they belong to an in-group while most of their fellow countrymen are, at best, opponents and, at worst, enemies. It is common to hear "I am first a Christian, and then an American," or "I am first a Conservative, and then an American," and similar statements. In large corporations, the attitude of "company first, country second" is typical. 
</p>

<a name="engagement"/>
<h3>1.2. Engagement and Participation in the System</h3>

<p>
A very large proportion of the population resists contributing to the whole, for instance by (willingly) paying taxes, or participating in civic duties such as serving on juries, and many do not bother to cast votes in elections. Most of those who do cast votes do not thoroughly investigate the positions, proposals, or histories of the candidates. Many simply vote along party lines, and others vote for whichever candidate they have recently seen in campaign ads, or one whose name they recognize.
</p>

<a name="intolerance"/>
<h3>1.3. Intolerance of Differences</h3>

<p>
Coalescence into in-groups has reached the stage that most Americans cannot tolerate the existence of anyone who holds different beliefs or lives a different lifestyle from their own. This is reflected in the content and manner of expression of comments in the press and on social media, and in the frequent outbursts of violence, such as riots, excessive police response to riots, mass shootings, road rage, xenophobia, misogyny, homophobia, religious prejudice, and incidents of racism.
</p>
<p>
This problem is also evident in the passage of numerous laws in recent years that undermine human rights and individual liberty in favor of imposing the beliefs of an extremist minority on the population as a whole, gleefully and proudly trampling on the rights and the needs of others with no apparent positive end in mind, but merely as a wanton exercise of raw power.
</p>

<a name="isolationism"/>
<h3>1.4. Isolationism</h3>

<p>
Most Americans assume their country can continue to exist indefinitely without any interactions with other countries except to bully them into compliance, while also maintaining a low cost of living, a high material standard of living, and unfettered individual liberty. The result is a dangerous cultural blind spot that puts the country at risk. 
</p>

<a name="hubris"/>
<h3>1.5. Hubris</h3>

<p>
Most Americans assume they are inherently superior to all others, both on an individual level and a national level. However, they cannot quantify what this means, and objective assessment of their values, character, and behavior does not show evidence of superiority as compared with any other population.
</p>

<a name="criticalthinking"/>
<h3>1.6. Lack of Critical Thinking Skills</h3>

<p>
Only a small and dwindling number of Americans exhibit much ability to assess information critically. As a result, the population as a whole is highly susceptible to political propaganda, commercial advertising, and con games. Many cannot distinguish fact from fiction, or consider whether a statement is credible or not credible. They assume anything they agree with or that feels good to them is true, and everything else is false.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, Americans practice binary thinking, and can only conceive of ideas, institutions, and people in absolute terms. Anyone who cares for others is a communist. Anyone who is practical about funding public programs is a fascist. If you are religious, you must obey the most extreme orders from the leaders of your faith, or you are an apostate. If you are atheist and you dare to respect others who are religious, you are an idiot who believes in invisible beings. If you support abortion rights, then you must support abortion under any and all circumstances, for any reason and at any time; if you oppose abortion rights, then you must oppose abortion regardless of medical need, rape, incest, or any other circumstances. Either every matter must be handled by the private sector with no public oversight or accountability, or the government must take a direct hand in all matters. There is no sense of proportion or balance and no understanding of nuance or situational realities.
</p>
<p>
Many Americans exhibit magical thinking in one form or another. Many do not understand statistics, correlation, or causation; they think unrelated things are related, and related things are unrelated. Many believe any problem can be solved by throwing money at it, and criticize wealthy individuals and corporations for failing to "solve world hunger" and other problems. Many believe in horoscopes, ghosts, witches, zombies, werewolves, vampires, space aliens, and elaborate conspiracy theories that do not pass the simplest test of credibility.
</p>
<p>
Consider the way nearly all Americans think about the causes and solutions of national problems. While they say they believe in democracy, they demand that the President dictate solutions. When things are going well, they credit the President personally. When things are going badly, they blame the President personally. Yet, the US economy is a complex adaptive system with a long lag time before events or changes have a measurable effect; often much longer than the tenure of a President. Americans have demonstrated they are incapable of understanding this. They want immediate, simple solutions to complicated problems, and they expect to see results in a short time. They want to vote and to be seen as independent thinkers, but at the same time they want "someone" to tell them what is true and what they should do. As a result, many fall prey to populist demagogues and professional propagandists.
</p>

<a name="ignorance"/>
<h3>1.7. Ignorance of and Disconnection from Their Own History</h3>

<p>
Few Americans understand much about the history of America. What they consider to be "history" is largely a made-up story designed to encourage the belief in American Exceptionalism and to condition the working class to accept as "normal" and "inevitable" an inferior state of existence in a society dominated by power elites whose privileged status has been decreed by God. 
</p>
<p>
</p>

<a name="corruption"/>
<h3>1.8. Corruption</h3>

<p>
The fact the US was originally organized to protect the wealth, property interests, and political power of the elite of that era does not make it appropriate or acceptable for the country to continue to operate on that basis in modern times. A two-party system is not defined in the US Constitution in the first place. The dynamics of the system almost inevitably lead to a two-party format, effectively locking out other perspectives and preventing proportional representation of our highly diverse population.
</p>
<p>
At present, one of the two main parties - the Republican Party - is engaged in a blatant bid to take power by any means necessary in direct contravention of the US Constitution and US law. They are a cabal of politicians and commercial interests, supported by constituents who have been influenced by the party's highly successful propaganda program, which they call the Strategic Communications program, or StratCom. 
</p>
<p>
The other main party - the Democratic Party - seems also to be little more than a cabal of special interests, even if they have not (yet) gone so far as to subvert democratic institutions, and they have no credible or competent propaganda program. The weakness of the Democrats is that they tend to get caught up in circular debates and never come to a consensus about how to solve problems. Extremists in both parties hold sway and pull the mainstream party membership to the edges.
</p>
Smaller parties struggle to gain popular support and have almost no chance of breaking into the system. Apart from that, none of the smaller parties has a comprehensive platform - each one is either (a) a single-issue party that lacks the vision to address the nation's problems across the board (Green Party - environment; New Progressive Party - Puerto Rican statehood), or (b) a vehicle to promote a particular political ideology, without regard for the practical effects on real people of implementing that ideology (Party for Socialism and Liberation - Marxism-Leninism; Libertarian Party - Libertarianism). They seek to implement their ideology for its own sake, and not to support practical goals to benefit the American people.
</p>
<p>
The practice of "lobbying," as well as the numerous business, family, and personal connections between private-sector and public-sector leaders mean that any meaningful separation between private and public sectors is a sham. This is nothing short of institutionalized corruption that favors the wealthiest few at the expense of the many, and to the detriment of the country.
</p>
<p>
 It is not possible for ordinary Americans to prosper and to live in freedom under this system.
</p>

<a name="policybacklash"/>
<h3>1.9. Backlash from Foreign Policy</h3>

<p>
The US government has long applied an approach to foreign affairs based on the assumption that America is entitled to use any and all means to force its will on others. This has resulted in considerable harm to people around the world. The rest of the world has begun to assert itself and to push back on America, but American leaders have been slow to recognize the trend. Continuing with traditional thinking about foreign affairs is making matters worse for America.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<a name="endofera"/>
<h3>1.10. End of the Era of Anglo Hegemony</h3>

<p>
The US has been part of, and has benefited from the general cultural dominance of anglophone culture, which we see as a lingering effect of the long-defunct British Empire, carried forward through military force by the United States from the 1890s onward, and accelerating after World War II. The world is shifting away from this, and cultural centers quite different from our own are becoming more prominent, influential, and confident of themselves. American leaders seem oblivious to this trend, and are taking no action to ensure our country can survive and prosper in the new world order that is emerging. 
</p>
<p>
The belief that US international power is a gift from God leads American leaders to assume the US' position in the world order is ordained, permanent, immutable, and unbreakable. This is an extremely dangerous myth.
</p>

<a name="supplychain"/>
<h3>1.11. Fragility of the Global Just-in-Time Supply Chain</h3>

<p>
Over the past few decades, the world has shifted from well-defined national economic systems in which each country made trade arrangements independently with other countries toward a global order in which individual countries became specialized exporters of particular goods. Provided most of the world was at peace most of the time, this enabled a just-in-time supply chain for all kinds of goods. When it works, this system is efficient and makes for lower prices and higher availability of goods for everyone. But the system depends on everything operating as intended with no interruptions or breakdowns.
</p>
<p>
In recent years, the inherent weaknesses of this system have become increasingly apparent. A topical example at the time of writing is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The war has disrupted the global supplies of wheat, heating oil, and cooking oil. Some 40 million people in northern Africa and the Middle East are at risk of malnutrition or starvation. This is a glaring example of a general problem - the global supply chain only functions when everything is moving along nicely. Any problem, from a war to a hurricane to a bad crop year to a single ship aground in the Suez Canal, can disrupt the lives of people all around the world, because they have become completely dependent on this fragile system, and they have no local or regional backup system. 
</p>
<p>
Our country needs to be independent with respect to certain basic needs so that we can continue to live in freedom according to our own values even when there are problems around the world. When we consider this factor in conjunction with item 1.10, it becomes clear that continuing to operate as part of a global system puts us at risk of interference from foreign countries whose values are at odds with our own. Greed, short-term thinking, and corruption on the part of present-day political and business leaders place Americans at high risk.
</p>

<a name="positive"/>
<h2>2. Positive Factors</h2>

<p>
We observe that <em>circa</em> 2022 America suffers from a number of deep problems. We further observe few, if any of these problems can be addressed effectively through the existing political system. The challenges in creating a new political system and solving the serious problems facing America are tremendous. 
</p>
<p>
On a positive note, this country has many strengths and advantages we can build on to help us improve the situation and make necessary changes in American institutions. Some of these advantages may be unique in the world, giving us a strong foundation on which to build a country that can achieve the goal of the State: To establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty without external interference.
</p>

<a name="territory"/>
<h3>2.1. Size of Territory</h3>

<p>
America is among the largest countries in the world in terms of land area. Provided we organize things within that territory to maximize resiliency and recoverability (as opposed to maximizing short-term efficiency to achieve incremental gains in profit), we can make it extremely difficult for any foreign power or non-governmental organization to do wide-ranging or lasting harm to the country and its people. This is a significant advantage.
</p>

<a name="population"/>
<h3>2.2. Size of Population</h3>

<p>
At the time of writing, the population of the US is approximately 330 million people. This is a tremendous source of creativity, innovation, and labor. We have more than enough people to realize any vision they might have for their future, provided they can stop fighting each other and start thinking about the future.
</p>

<a name="resources"/>
<h3>2.3. Abundance and Diversity of Resources</h3>

<p>
The territory of America is highly diverse and contains an abundance of natural resources of all kinds. Some analysts have stated that this is the only country in the world that actually could sustain itself without any dependencies on other countries. If we can "get our house in order," we can certainly take advantage of this.
</p>

<a name="economy"/>
<h3>2.4. Economic Power</h3>

<p>
As of the time of writing, the US accounts for some 24 to 25 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), making it the world's largest economy by a large margin. China accounts for 17 to 18 percent of global GDP, and Japan for just under 6 percent. No other national economy or economic bloc is significant by comparison.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the size of the economy, there is a qualitative difference. The US is a wealth-generating economy based on creativity and innovation, while other national economies are manufacturing centers (e.g., China, Japan, South Korea), agricultural exporters (Ukraine, Thailand, Uruguay), or suppliers of natural resources and raw materials (Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil). This gives us a great advantage in meeting our goal of independence from foreign imports and influence, provided the State can be established before the people destroy their own country from within.
</p>

<a name="economy"/>
<h3>2.5. Friendly Neighbors</h3>

<p>
No two neighboring countries agree about everything, and all neighbors have their share of disagreements and disputes. America is no different; whether it is a dispute with Canada over fishing rights or friction with Mexico over illegal border crossings, we have our disagreements. On balance, however, America's immediate neighbors are friendly nations. We need not expend resources to militarize our borders, and we can use those resources instead to solve our internal problems and build the country we want for the people.
</p>

<a name="resiliency"/>
<h3>2.6. Resiliency</h3>

<p>
America has a remarkable ability to bounce back from disasters. Hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, terrorist attacks and other events that would devastate most other countries for years or decades seem to be absorbed almost routinely by America. This resiliency or survivability offers a strong foundation for a truly independent America.
</p>

<a name="infrastructure"/>
<h3>2.7. Infrastructure</h3>

<p>
Notwithstanding the failure to maintain existing infrastructure, noted frequently in the press for many years and recently coming to a head with the expensive infrastructure bill passed by Congress, beneath all the problems there lies a robust and extensive infrastructure for transportation, energy, and communication. 
</p>
<p>
The State considers infrastructure to be part of the Three Pillars of Independence - food, energy, and defense - and will therefore ensure infrastructure is maintained routinely, rather than being allowed to deteriorate for years, and then having to be repaired all at once at great cost. 
</p>
<p>
</p>

<a name="state"/>
<h2>3. Fundamental Principles of the State</h2>

<p>
The State is not based on any conventional political ideology. We have considered the common characteristics of Americans, based on their own words, impressions by foreigners, observations of Americans' behavior, and socio-political models. Based on those characteristics, we have defined a small set of guiding principles we believe will establish the conditions wherein Americans can live as they choose to live, according to their own values, without any external (foreign) interference.
</p>

<a name="kidwisdom"/>
<h3>3.1. Kindergarten Wisdom</h3>
<p>
The most fundamental principle of the State is one we think is very simple, and very American. It is the idea that each American ought to be able to live in the way they choose, according to the values they believe in, and to exercise the maximum level of individual liberty that is possible without interfering with anyone else's ability to do the same. 
</p>
<p>
It is the principle that "my rights end where yours begin." This seems so basic and so obvious to us that we call it Kindergarten Wisdom. In the event any two concepts, rights, procedures, or laws are in conflict, the way to resolve the conflict is to apply Kindergarten Wisdom. Only if that fails should we resort to remedies such as lawsuits or trials. Even then, the formal adjudication of disputes will be based primarily on Kindergarten Wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Kindergarten Wisdom seems particularly relevant in a country whose population is as diverse as ours. Many different political, social, and religious belief systems are in play. Every individual American is entitled to live according to their own beliefs, and no one is entitled to trample on other people's ability to follow their own beliefs, no matter how different they may be, except when such beliefs violate the law. 
</p>
<p>
The practical challenge in implementing Kindergarten Wisdom is the fact so many Americans today simply do not want to acknowledge that anyone other than themselves has any rights at all, and are unwilling to constrain their behavior in any way out of respect for other people. Correcting that problem will require cultural change.
</p>

<a name="humanrights/">
<h3>3.2. Human Rights</h3>
<p>
Our position is that all human beings have certain natural rights by virtue of the fact they are human beings. These rights cannot be granted or stripped away by any authority - not the State, nor any individual or organization of any kind, whether humanitarian, commercial, or religious. 
</p>
<p>
We observe that Americans do not agree and cannot compromise with respect to basic definitions, such as: When does the human life span begin and end? Is a person who does not conform with the norms defined by a particular religious tradition considered "human" or not? Is a person who belongs to a minority ethnic group "fully human?" Does a person have the right to end their own life to avoid years of pain due to terminal illness? Does a woman have the right to abort a pregnancy, and if so, under what conditions? Does the State have the right to end a person's life as punishment for a crime? Do individuals forfeit their human rights when they go to work for a company, join a club, commit a crime, or set foot on private property? Are persons who illegally entered the country entitled to human rights? Are prisoners of war entitled to human rights? Are terrorists entitled to human rights? How are human rights defended on behalf of individuals who cannot stand up for themselves, such as a person with brain damage or dementia, or a healthy, developing fetus? Which rights are, in fact, natural human rights and which are legal/civil rights or privileges?
</p>
<p>
Because Americans have demonstrated over a period of many years that they are incapable of reaching a consensus or agreeing to a practical  compromise on these questions, the State will define these matters in the law.
</p>

<a name="legalrights"/>
<h3>3.3. Legal Rights</h3>
<p>
Legal rights define the norms, standards, and procedures for interaction between the general population and official representatives of the State, such as law enforcement, the courts, and operating units that provide public services. They are distinct from human rights in that they are not part of one's innate humanity as such, but are determined constitutionally and legislatively. They are similar to human rights in that no entity, including the State itself, is authorized to deny anyone their legal rights. 
</p>

<a name="privileges"/>
<h3>3.4. Privileges</h3>
<p>
Privileges define the ability of a person or organization legally to engage in some specific activity, when the activity requires training, licensure, or certification of some kind. Privileges must be earned by fulfilling the requirements specified by the governing organization with authority to regulate the particular activity. Privileges can be forfeited or suspended when those requirements are not fulfilled.
</p>

<a name="duties"/>
<h3>3.5. Duties</h3>
<p>
Duties are actions or behaviors expected of an individual or organization with respect to their formal responsibilities or with respect to their interaction with other individuals and organizations. The State has duties to the people, and the people have duties to one another. Individuals and organizations engaged in privileged activities have a duty to maintain the requirements associated with that privilege.
</p>


<a name="independence"/>
<h3>3.6. The Three Pillars of Independence</h3>
<p>
In our view, the State cannot fulfill its duty to the people to establish and sustain conditions under which Americans can live according to their own values and exercise their individual liberty without external interference unless it can operate on a sustainable basis without dependencies on foreign sources for certain key needs. These needs are food, energy, and defense.
</p>

<a name="indfood"/>
<h4>3.6.1. Food Production, Quality, and Distribution</h3>
<p>
Independence in food production means national self-sufficiency in the production, quality control, and distribution of basic foodstuffs in sufficient quantity, and of sufficient diversity, to feed the American people without the need for any imported foods. Every type of business operation that touches on independence in this area will be subject to regulation and oversight.
</p>

<a name="indenergy"/>
<h4>3.6.2. Energy Production and Distribution</h3>
<p>
Independence in energy production means national self-sufficiency in the production of energy and its distribution to points of use. Every type of business operation that touches on independence in this area will be subject to regulation and oversight.
</p>

<a name="inddefense"/>
<h4>3.6.3. National Defense</h3>
<p>
Independence in national defense means the ability to protect the country from attack by foreign powers (governments and nation-states or any other organization or individual) without dependence on assistance from other countries. Every type of business operation that touches on independence in this area will be subject to regulation and oversight. 
</p>


<a name="publicprivate"/>
<h3>3.7. Public and Private Sectors</h3>
<p>
One of the ways in which Americans exhibit binary thinking is in their conception of the proper role of the government and the proper role of the private sector. Some Americans want virtually no government at all while others want a strong government that takes a direct hand in many aspects of life. 
</p>
<p>
Taking a practical view rather than an ideological one, we conclude that some things are best handled by the private sector and others by the public sector. Our general philosophy favors a light touch by government, but this is not an ideologically-driven view; in matters where a strong hand is appropriate, we favor a strong hand. We favor whatever achieves the purpose of the State, to establish conditions wherein Americans can live in freedom, sustainably.
</p>
<p>
For the most part, we see the role of government as limited to setting standards, performing oversight, enforcing regulations, and providing financial incentives to the private sector to encourage people and companies to do "the right thing." This function is limited to the State's duty to protect and unphold human rights and legal rights and its role in assuring the Three Pillars of Independence are maintained on a sustainable basis. The State will stay out of other matters. Private companies generally function more efficiently and cost-effectively than government bureacracies.
</p>
<p>
In a few areas, private sector greed trumps the general good, or short-term profit-seeking by the few trumps long-term benefit for the many. Situations like those call for a more-enlightened and objective guide to illuminate the path. The State will play a more direct role, in keeping with its duty to the people.
</p>

<a name="sustainability"/>
<h3>3.8. Sustainability</h3>
<p>
All these fine things - liberty, human rights, equality under the law, prosperity, comfort, safety - will be of little use if they fade away in a few months or years. The system must be designed and operated for long-term sustainability. 
</p>

<a name="singlenation"/>
<h3>3.9. Single Nation</h3>
<p>
When the US was founded, the various states were culturally unique and operated almost at the level of independent countries. Each was founded by different people for different reasons to solve different problems or to provide a new home for a different group. In today's world, the US functions as a single nation for most purposes. The existence of 50 different sets of laws and standards and 50 different government bureaucracies is wasteful and counterproductive. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, America will be a single nation-state. The former states will exist as historical entities only, in recognition of cultural traditions of identity with a state, but will not have autonomous governments. If the residents of some of the former states feel strongly about their state identity, they may petition the State to separate from America peacefully. 
</p>

<a name="engagement"/>
<h3>3.10. Engagement and Citizenship</h3>
<p>
The State is a hybrid authoritarian/democratic system. That in itself is nothing new for Americans - the present system in the US is also a hybrid in which people elect representatives who then pass laws and deal with the operation of government without further instructions from the people. 
</p>
<p>
We observe many of the problems with the present US system stem from the fact literally anyone can vote with the same weight. The dangerous results of the 2016 election came about because a large number of ignorant people were convinced to support a populist demagogue. The State must be designed to enable Americans to have a voice in their government while providing protection against decisions that risk destroying the very system that enables that freedom in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Studies have shown that in any democratic system, members who have a high level of engagement with the system and who have a stake in the success of the system tend to make decisions that are more beneficial for the full membership. Those who have a low level of engagement and have (or feel they have) little stake in the success of the system tend to make decisions that support their personal preferences at the expense of the whole.
</p>
<p>
We also observe that many Americans see themselves as "islands" who are completely self-sufficient, who owe nothing to their fellow countrymen, and who are successful purely due to their own efforts, acknowledging no assistance or support from the system, any institutions, or any individuals. These are the people who say things like "taxation is theft" and who believe no one is "automatically" entitled to healthcare, education, or even oxygen. 
</p>
<p>
To accommodate citizens in that category, to avoid election outcomes like the disaster of 2016, and to ensure those who make key decisions for the country are invested and engaged in the system, the State will have two levels of citizenship and three levels of voting. The State will fund certain social benefits through taxation, and will separate the taxes for certain benefits so that independent-minded citizens can opt out of both the tax and the benefit. 
</p>
<p>
Engagement has a strong correlation with thoughtful decision-making. A second correlation, weaker than engagement, is one's level of education. The system of voting weights takes these two factors into consideration, with engagement having the greater impact on citizen privileges and duties, and education having a lesser impact.
</p>
<p>
Basic Citizenship is a legal right and Full Citizenship is an earned Privilege. Basic Citizenship can never be revoked, even if an individual explicitly revokes their citizenship, and even if a foreign government does not recognize State citizenship after a citizen moves to that country and adopts citizenship there. An American can always come home. 
</p>
<p>
One of the requirements for Full Citizenship is to opt in to all income taxes to indicate one's full commitment to the country. Other requirements may pertain, such as having no current criminal convictions. The details are a matter of statutory law and out of scope here.

<a name="transition"/>
<h2>4. Transitional Period</h2>
<p>
The shift from the present system in the US to the State system includes massive and extensive changes at all levels. It cannot be accomplished with the flick of a switch. Any attempt to implement the State abruptly will cause severe disruptions to the economy, stability, and everyday life of the country.
</p>
<p>
We call for a comprehensive transition plan to be defined before attempting to implement the State. Expect the shift to take some time - possibly more than a decade. We must also expect to discover unforeseen challenges along the way, so we must be ready to adapt the plan based on lessons learned during the process.
