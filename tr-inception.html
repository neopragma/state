<h1>Transition Plan - Inception Stage</h1>

<p>
<a href="tr-approval.html">&lt;= Previous</a> | <a href="tr-dual-system.html">Next =&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
	The Inception Stage is the first point in the process when we substitute action for words. This is when we intend to establish the administrative structures for the new government. The scope of these changes and the impact on those who benefit from the existing system mean that the Inception Stage is the single riskiest part of the transition. 
</p>
<p>
	People who, until now, have expressed verbal support for the American State will now be asked to take direct action. Will they? There is no way to know in advance. 
</p>
<p>
	Even if we have achieved a tipping point with respect to general popular support and support within the US military, we will not be able to institute new administrative units of government without the active participation of many thousands of individuals who are part of the existing US system, at the local, state, and federal levels. We lack both the numbers and the expertise to do so. 
</p>
<p>
	A significant proportion of them must <em>want</em> to see things operated in a different way, and help establish the administrative apparatus to do so. Otherwise, nothing will happen. If people decline to act, the initiative will halt. Opponents needn't even shut us down by force; inaction will be sufficient. The existing system is already in place. If no action is taken to change that, then it will continue to exist. 
</p>
<p>
	Assuming a sufficient number of people do act, there will still be several (if not many) challenges to deal with simultaneously. Some states might resist the idea of a single nationwide government, and use their National Guard forces to oppose the change. US military forces will be divided as to whether to support or oppose the changes, and some units may fight against each other, against state National Guards, or against grassroots activists. Existing paramilitary fringe groups may try to take advantage of the chaos to their own advantage. 
</p>
<p>
	External actors, including foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations such as drug cartels and terror groups, will attempt to establish footholds on American territory, using the civil war as a cover. Some of the old Confederate states may try to reestablish the old Confederacy, notwithstanding the fact we intend to help them establish their own country. Mexico may try to reclaim territory taken by the US in the 19th century. Russia may move into Alaska. Inevitably, there will be disruptions in agriculture, manufacturing, shipping, electrical power, water and sewer systems, and other industies. Individual Americans who harbor ill will toward others will use the chaos as cover for their own violence.
</p>
<p>
	While Americans are preoccupied with these internal matters, international ripples may affect tens of millions of people. Russia may consolidate power in Europe; Iran in the Middle East; China in Taipei and elsewhere; North Korea across the peninsula. 
</p>
<p>
	To succeed, the Inception Phase must have strong support across the board at the outset, and must be completed as quickly as possible. If we make the decision to move forward, we must understand that the country will incur damage. To minimize that damage, we will have to act in ways contrary to the values and principles we ultimately wish to establish. 
</p>

<h3>Inception Stage: Preparation Phase</h3>

<p>
	Due to the unique challenges of the Inception Stage, we anticipate two phases of action will be needed. In the Preparation phase, we will actively recruit people in key roles and seek their commitment to the establishment of the State. Depending on their positions in the existing power structure, some may be able to commit publicly while others may have to maintain a low profile until the Implementation phase begins. 
</p>
<p>
	There are many unknowns and many risks. Some of those who commit may be acting on behalf of the existing power elite, waiting for the moment to betray us. Others will be sincere, but when push comes to shove will be too frightened to act. Others may simply have a change of heart. Anything may happen.
</p>
<p>
	In any case, we must do our best to have as many people in place as possible before attempting Implementation. Ideally, we want to see the new system "switch on" almost instantaneously, with mostly the same individuals operating it as were operating the old system. In fact, the next stage is called the Dual-System Stage, because we cannot realistically replace the entire government apparatus in a single step.
</p>
<p>
	On the military side of things, we need to recruit a substantial proportion of US military and state National Guard leaders and units. It is likely there will be a need to suppress violent opposition in the early months of the Inception Stage. We will need to complete that process before we can initiate the Dual-System Stage. There is also the risk of foreign intervention and of violent action by nongovernmental groups, which must be suppressed immediately.
</p>

<h3>Inception Stage: Implementation Phase</h3>

<p>
	The basic plan for Implementation is to have administrative units of the government change from the existing system of local, state, and federal offices to the new system of a single nationwide hierarchy. We are not planning deep functional changes until the Dual-System Stage. We are not planning sweeping personnel changes. We are not planning to usurp local autonomy immediately. The change will be significant in that the system of government will be replaced, but the immediate impact on the ground will be minimal.
</p>
<p>
	For most government employees, that means changes on paper but not in the office. Their boss' boss' boss' boss may have a different job title, but they're probably still the same person. Now the employees work for the federal government instead of the state, county, or city, but their everyday duties are the same as before. Their job titles are mostly the same. Their pay is the same. Their working lives are the same.
</p>
<p>
	Most government employees are not particulary ambitious on a personal level. They chose careers in government because there are well-established rules they can learn and follow, and someone in authority to tell them what to do. They don't want responsibility. They don't want to stick their necks out.
</p>
<p>
	If we can recruit most of the managers of existing bureaucratic units, they can simply tell their staff that they will be continuing to perform the same kind of work as before, and they will not experience much difference in their day-to-day lives. Each staff member need not be recruited. Some of them will probably quit their jobs if they feel strongly opposed to the State, but we do not anticipate this will create overall disruption.
</p>
<p>
	The private sector will be largely unaffected by the Inception Stage. Companies operating in multiple states will no longer have to deal with multiple corporate registrations and multiple state tax laws, although those changes will be phased in over time and will not take effect immediately. Corporate leaders are likely to see those changes as positive, as they will simplify paperwork and regulatory compliance as well as reducing operating costs. 
</p>
<p>
	Most corporate leaders today already hold the view, "company over country," and will not care deeply about what sort of governmental system the country has, as long as they are free to continue doing business. Many have demonstrated time and again that they consider neither morality nor political philosophy when choosing to do business with totalitarian regimes abroad. They will not suddenly become philosophical.
</p>
<p>
	Private sector employees will be affected more-or-less the same way as government employees; effectively, no change. While some may feel some sort of emotional call to oppose the change, there isn't really any objective reason for them to do so. They cannot obtain any material advantage by resisting.
</p>
<p>
	Some who benefit from the existing system will feel as if the switch to the State system will reduce their power, wealth, and/or future prospects. Others, not benefiting from the existing system, will see the Inception as an opportunity to grab power for themselves, perhaps feeling entitled to have a turn at the helm. 
</p>
<p>
	There will be cases when these people take violent action against the new government. We must be prepared to shut them down immediately and definitively, to minimize overall economic disruption, long-term damage, and ripple effects. 
</p>
<p>
	Some extremist paramilitary groups will have supported our cause for their own reasons. We should use them to suppress other extremist paramilitary groups who oppose us, as a practical efficiency.
</p>

<h3>Ending the Inception Stage</h3>

<p>
	Once physical opposition has been quelled and the new administrative units have been established, we can close down the Inception Stage and move on to the Dual-System Stage. Then we can begin the less-dramatic but more-important work of gradually changing administrative operations from old to new.
