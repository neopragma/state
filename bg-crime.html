<a name="philosophy"/>
<h2>1. Philosophy of Crime and Punishment</h2>

<p>
This section outlines key ideas in the State's philosophy of crime and punishment. Some of these ideas may be different from what the reader is accustomed to.
</p>
<p>
It is possible the single most significant difference is the State's conception of what constitutes an offense. In the present-day US, an offense is simply a violation of the letter of statutory law. Under the State system, someone has to be offended before there is an offense. That is, there has to be a victim or at least property damage. The severity of a crime is determined by the nature and scope of the <em>harm done</em>, and not by which particular statute was violated. Two violations of the same statute might result in very different penalties based on the harm done in each case.
</p>

<a name="humanrights"/>
<h3>1.1. Human Rights</h3>

<p>
The importance of upholding human rights is paramount. An offense that includes any violation of human rights will be treated as a crime of the highest severity.
</p>
<p>
By the same token, accused offenders will not be mistreated or tortured, regardless of the severity of their crimes. There will be no death penalty, although a suspect may choose death in the process of arrest. The State respects individuals' freedom of choice.
</p>

<a name="legalrights"/>
<h3>1.2. Legal Rights</h3>

<p>
Offenders who violate the legal rights of others will be guilty of a serious crime. By the same token, the State and its delegates will not violate the legal rights of suspects or convicted offenders.
</p>

<a name="incarceration"/>
<h3>1.3. Minimal Incarceration</h3>

<p>
One of the oddities of the present-day US is the fact that it imprisons more people, both on a <em>per capita</em> basis and in absolute terms, than any other country in the world, including the most horrific dictatorships. Most of the inmates are guilty of non-violent crimes and are not dangerous individuals. Many of their offenses would not be against the law under the State system. Many have been wrongly convicted. Other countries have successfully carried out "decarceration" programs with no ill effects to their societies.
</p>
<p>
For those reasons, the State will use incarceration as a punishment for the most severe offenses and for offenders who appear to pose a threat to public safety, even if their offenses are minor. For most offenses, the State will seek alternative punishments, as described below.
</p>

<a name="compensation"/>
<h3>1.4. Victim Compensation</h3>

<p>
Many kinds of criminal offenses are in the nature of taking things or damaging property that does not belong to the offender. In these cases, there is an identifiable victim or victims. Our philosophy is that the first order of business is to obtain compensation for the victim(s). If the offender has the practical ability to make the victims "whole," that will be their main punishment. Otherwise, courts will seek to provide compensation to victim(s) in some practical way. 
</p>

<a name="service"/>
<h3>1.5. Community Service</h3>

<p>
Minor offenses committed by people who are not dangerous may best be punished by requiring a period of community service.
</p>
                
<a name="intentoflaw"/>
<h3>1.6. Intent of the Law Trumps the Letter of the Law</h3>

<p>
In case the wording of a statute is ambiguous or in case of "trickery" to avoid the intent of a law by making a literal interpretation of the letter of the law, the intent of the law prevails.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> This will be inconvenient for some. For example, consider the way online app companies circumvent the intent of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, or COPPA, in the present-day US system. This aspect of State law will present a "quintuple whammy" to these companies: 
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Privacy is a human right, making violations of human rights a Category 1 offense;</li>
        <li>Abusing or taking advantage of minors increases the severity of an offense, thus increasing the penalty;</li> 
        <li>The intent of the law is to protect minors, so claims by app makers that they "did not know" the app was being used by a minor will not stand up in court as a defense (intent of the law trumps letter of the law);</li>
        <li>Lobbying is defined as a Category 1 offense, so lobbying the government to influence legislation to protect abusive business practices will be prosecuted; and</li>
        <li>Incorporation is not a legal shield for those who make the decisions to conduct illegal activities and/or those who carry out illegal activities.</li>
    </ol>
</p>


<a name="categories"/>
<h2>2. Categories of Offense</h2>

<p>
The severity of a crime and the appropriate punishment are determined by the nature and extent of the harm done, as well as other factors. This subsection concerns the nature and extent of harm.
</p>

<a name="category1"/>
<h3>2.1. Category 1: Egregious</h3>
<p>
Offenses that include violation of human rights and/or undermining of the Three Pillars of Independence are categorized as <em>Egregious</em>. This category represents the most serious crimes in the State system. A severe punishment is likely for convicted offenders. For non-Citizens, removal from the country is likely to follow their prison sentence.
</p>

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Refer to the <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-rights-and-duties.html">Backgrounder on Human Needs, Human Rights, Legal Rights, Privileges, Duties, and Freedom</a> for clarification about what we mean by "human rights." That document contains an <a href="file:///Users/davidnicolette/Documents/Projects/state/bg-rights-and-duties.html#enumeration">enumeration of the human rights</a> recognized by the State. You will find that, given that enumeration, crimes like murder are covered under the umbrella of "human rights." As we do not value anyone's life more than anyone else's, there is no need in the State system for the category, "capital murder;" and as we judge the severity of an offense more by its effects than by the intention of the offender, there is no need for differentiation such as "first degree murder," "second degree murder," or "manslaughter." As the first human right is the right to life, and human rights violations are the most egregious offenses by definition, all forms of murder are already covered.
</p>

<a name="category2"/>
<h3>2.2. Category 2: Serious</h3>
<p>
Offenses that include violation of legal rights and/or physical battery, assault, theft (by any name), property damage or destruction, or interference in the ability of another to exercise their individual liberty according to Kindergarten Wisdom are categorized as <em>Serious</em>. Punishment is likely to include restitution for the victim(s), and possibly community service and/or incarceration.  
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement personnel are not automatically exempt from laws against assault, battery, and murder. However, law enforcement personnel who can show they acted in good faith to uphold the legal rights of suspects, witnesses, and bystanders may not be considered to have committed an offense. 
</p>

<a name="category3"/>
<h3>2.3. Category 3: Minor</h3>
<p>
Offenses that do not result in human rights violations, undermining of the Three Pillars of Independence, violations of legal rights, physical assault, financial loss, or property damage will generally be treated as <em>Minor</em>, unless the overall context of the situation makes the offense more serious than that. Incarceration is unlikely. Rescinding of visas and expulsion from the country are unlikely. Community service is possible.
</p>


<a name="severity"/>
<h2>3. Determining the Severity of an Offense</h2>

<p>
The State judges the severity of an offense by the nature and extent of the harm done. If an act is technically contrary to the Legal Code, and yet no harm is done to any person or property and no degradation of the Three Pillars of Independence is caused, then the violation is hardly an "offense," as no one has been "offended." Even if you violate a statute by mistake, as long as no harm has been done it is unlikely you would be arrested or cited. This would not be a good use of the people's money.
</p>

<a name="nature"/>
<h3>3.1. Nature of Harm</h3>
<p>
There is a certain amount of human judgment in this, but in general we consider the harm done by an offense by checking the following things, in order:
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Were anyone's human rights violated? - Category 1</li>
		<li>Were the Three Pillars of Independence undermined in some way? - Category 1</li>
        <li>Did anyone suffer financial loss or property damage? - Category 2</li>
        <li>Were any legal statutes violated? - Category 2 or 3</li>
        <li>Was any harm done at all, even if a statute was violated? - Probably let it pass, worst case Category 3</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<a name="extent"/>
<h3>3.2. Extent of Harm</h3>
<p>
When the harm caused by an offense affects more than one person/victim, the severity of the offense is increased proportionally.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Were multiple people's human rights violated? - Category 1 with recommendation for severe punishment</li>
		<li>Were the Three Pillars of Independence undermined in a significant way? - Category 1 with recommendation for severe punishment</li>
        <li>Was there significant financial loss or property damage? - Category 2 possibly elevated to Category 1, or Category 2 with recommendation for strong punishment</li>
        <li>Were several legal statutes violated, or were there several counts of the same violation? - Category 2 (pattern of misbehavior)</li>
 	</ol>
</p>


<a name="punishment"/>
<h2>4. Determining Fair Punishment</h2>

<p>
Based on the severity of the offense, a default punishment will be determined. For some offenses, a range of punishments may be included with the definition of the statute that was violated. From that point, courts will apply the following criteria to adjust the punishment as appropriate.
</p>


<a name="punishcategory"/>
<h3>4.1. Category of the Offense</h3>

<p>
Barring unusual circumstances or context, a Category 1 offense will call for the most severe punishment, a Category 2 offense for less severe punishment, and a Category 3 offense for mild punishment.
</p>
<p>
A determination of category also includes a recommendation for more-severe or less-severe punishment based on the extent of the harm done.
</p>

<a name="punishcode"/>
<h3>4.2. Punishment Defined in the Legal Code</h3>

<p>
Some statutes include a minimum and maximum punishment for violating the statute. Whether to set the initial punishment at a higher or lower level within this range will depend on the category of the offense and the extent of the harm done.
</p>

<a name="victimage"/>
<h3>4.3. Victim's Age</h3>

<p>
When one or more of the victims of an offense is/are below the age of majority, the punishment for the offense is increased.
</p>


<a name="intent"/>
<h3>4.4. Offender's Intent</h3>

<p>
The offender's intent when carrying out the act in question will be considered in determining appropriate punishment. Examples of intent:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Deliberate act with malicious intent - no reduction in punishment</li>
		<li>Unintentional act caused by not paying attention - definitely negligence - no reduction in punishment</li>
		<li>Deliberate act with positive intent, but poor judgment - possible reduction in punishment</li>
		<li>Unintentional act that could not be foreseen - accidental harm - probable reduction in punishment</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<a name="circumstances"/>
<h3>4.5. Mitigating Circumstances</h3>

<p>
The circumstances surrounding the offense will be considered in determining appropriate punishment. If the offender chose the lesser of two harmful acts in an attempt to minimize damage and harm, punishment will probably be reduced.
</p>

<a name="history"/>
<h3>4.6. Offender's Criminal History</h3>

<p>
Offenders who have no previous criminal history, or only a few minor offenses, may receive a reduction in punishment. Offenders who have an excessive criminal history may not receive reductions in punishment that would normally be granted for other reasons. In some cases, the offender's history may justify increasing sentences or calling for incarceration for offenses that normally would not require incarceration; in particular, a history of violence or of ignoring restraining orders.
</p>

<a name="attitude"/>
<h3>4.7. Offender's Attitude During Investigation and Trial</h3>

<p>
A positive and cooperative attitude and evidence of sincere regret or remorse may lead to a reduction in punishment. An aggressive or cocky attitude may lead the court not to apply reductions in punishment that would normally be granted for other reasons.
</p>

<a name="witnesses"/>
<h3>4.8. Testimony of Character Witnesses</h3>

<p>
Character witnesses may be called (or volunteer to testify) in trials. They are not witnesses to the offense. They testify as to the character of the accused, either positively or negatively. The court may consider their testimony to help determine fair punishment.
</p>

<a name="offenderage"/>
<h3>4.9. Offender's Age</h3>

<p>
Offenders below the age of majority are treated with more leniency than adult offenders, unless the nature and extent of the harm done is severe.
</p>

<a name="mentalstate"/>
<h3>4.10. Offender's Mental State</h3>

<p>
An offender who was not in a "normal" mental state at the time of the offense may not have been capable of understanding what they were doing. This will be considered in determining fair punishment, unless the nature and extent of the harm done is severe.
</p>

<a name="courtjudgment"/>
<h3>4.11. The Court's Best Judgment</h3>

<p>
The court may weigh factors other than those listed and apply their best judgment to each case. They may form an opinion about the offender in the course of the trial, based on direct exposure to the accused and/or testimony and evidence.
</p>

<a name="precedent"/>
<h3>4.12. Precedent</h3>

<p>
Legal precedent is a large factor in the current US system. Under the State system, precedent may be considered in the interest of consistent treatment of offenders, but by intent it is not to be given as much weight as it receives in the US system. In the US system, precedent is often applied in a way that reproduces or magnifies the injustice of the original ruling. 
</p>

<h2>5. Debt as a "Crime"</h2>

<p>
    For historical reasons, US law treats failure to repay debt as a serious crime. The historical reasons are (a) US law is based on English law, which severely punished poor people for being poor; and (b) the US system was originally designed to maximize the power and wealth of the elite, and has legal structures that create a very uneven "playing field," such as the concept of the inviolability of contracts - historically enforced against those who lacked political power and financial resources, but not against members of the power elite. Much of US law was designed to enable the power elite to take the property of those who were attempting to live up to the promise of the Constitution by working diligently and honestly. 
</p>
<p>
    The State system is based on human rights and sustainable individual liberty. The concept of "crime" is based on the nature and extent of the harm done, and not (necessarily) on whether someone breached a contractual agreement to pay a debt. Failure to pay a debt <em>does</em> do harm to the creditor, but the <em>nature</em> of the harm does not call for harsh punishment. When we are talking about the level of debt an individual debtor may have, the <em>extent</em> of the harm is also small. An appropriate response is to make the debtor repay the debt, plus reasonable damages. 
</p>
<p>
    One problem with the present-day US system is the excessive use of lawsuits. Disputes about debt repayment often end up in an extended back-and-forth between attorneys who file suits and counter-suits. No one benefits from this except the attorneys, who always get paid and who carry no risk. 
</p>
<p>
    An aspect of our philosophy is that individual liberty comes with individual responsibility. Those offering financing are responsible for vetting applicants' creditworthiness. Borrowers are responsible for living up to the repayment terms to which they have agreed. 
</p>
<p>
    "Collection agencies" are categorically illegal under the State system. They violate laws prohibiting harassment and interference in people's personal lives and work. 
</p>
<p>
    Here is a hypothetical scenario that illustrates our thinking about debt-related disputes. We believe this addresses the problems with the present-day US system as well as supporting the relevant aspects of the underlying philosophy of the State.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Creditor lends money or otherwise provides financing to debtor for some purpose.</li>
        <li>2. Debtor agrees to the terms for repayment of the debt.
            <ul> 
                <li>2.1. Debtor makes payments toward repayment of the debt.</li>
                <li>2.2. Debtor repays the amount due. [END]</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>3. Debtor cannot meet the terms of repayment for some reason.
            <ul>
                <li>3.1. Debtor negotiates revised repayment terms with creditor.
                    <ul>
                        <li>3.1.1. The parties agree to new terms. [TO STEP 2.1]</li>
                        <li>3.1.2. The parties cannot reach agreement. [TO STEP 3.2.2]</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>3.2. Debtor ceases payments but does not communicate with creditor.
                    <ul>
                        <li>3.2.1. Creditor attempts to contact debtor.
                            <ul>
                                <li>3.2.1.1. Debtor is amenable to discussion with creditor. [TO STEP 3.1]</li>
                                <li>3.2.1.2. Debtor is unresponsive. [TO STEP 3.2.2]</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>3.2.2. Creditor files complaint with a court.
                            <ul>
                                <li>3.2.2.1. Court reviews the terms of the debt agreement.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>3.2.2.1.1. Court decides to enforce the debt agreement. [TO STEP 4]</li>
                                        <li>3.2.2.1.2. Court determines contract is unenforceable.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>3.2.2.1.2.1. Court restructures the contract. [TO STEP 2.1]</li>
                                                <li>3.2.2.1.2.2. Court voids the contract. [TO STEP 6]</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>3.3. Debtor declares personal bankruptcy. [END]</li>
                <li>3.4. Creditor decides to write off the loss and not to pursue legal remedies. [END]</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>4. The matter goes into mandatory arbitration.
            <ul>
                <li>4.1. Debtor adheres to the terms arising from arbitration. [TO STEP 2.1]</li>
                <li>4.2. Debtor fails to adhere to the terms arising from arbitration. [TO STEP 5]</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>5. The court enforces debt repayment. (See notes below.)</li>
        <li>6. Creditor and debtor opportunity to appeal. One appeal only by each. [TO STEP 3.2.2.1]</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Court enforcement of debt repayment (Step 4 above) is subject to the following rules:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Failure to repay debt is a Category 3 offense, carrying no prison term and resulting in no criminal record. However, it will affect debtor's credit worthiness.</li>
        <li>Tort law may be used to recover losses due to misdeeds, but not for debt collection.</li>
        <li>Personal bankruptcy is not an escape from a court-enforced debt repayment plan. In keeping with the concept of personal responsibility, if debtor has no option but to declare bankruptcy, they should do so before the matter reaches this stage. Should debtor fail to comply with the court's repayment plan, is it likely they will never be able to obtain credit again. That would be their punishment.</li>
        <li>Debtor assets are calculated as of the date of the original contract with creditor. This is to protect creditor in case debtor moves assets to avoid confiscation for enforced debt repayment.</li>
        <li>Under a debt repayment enforcement plan, debtor makes payments to the court and the court makes payments to creditor. Debtor and creditor no longer interact directly.</li>
        <li>Court can collect amount owed through any combination of:
            <ul>
                <li>Confiscation of debtor's assets up to a maximum of the lesser of (a) the amount owed and (b) 10% of debtor's assets. Collection may be arranged in installments or as a lump sum. Debtor's primary residence cannot be confiscated, and they cannot be deprived of every means of transportation to their jobs. Small business owners and individuals who work from home cannot be deprived of equipment and tools necessary for their work.</li>
                <li>Garnishment of debtor's income up to a maximum of 25% until the amount owed has been paid. The court may set the garnishment at a lesser amount, at its discretion. The intent is that courts will consider mitigating circumstances and the debtor's attitude toward the process in setting the level of garnishment.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Interest and penalties on the amount owed may accrue (at the court's discretion) starting from the date of the first missed payment at a rate the lesser of (a) the prime rate as of the first payment date and (b) one percent (1%) compounded monthly, accumulating until the total amount owed is 125% of the original debt. In no case will debtor owe more than 125% of the original amount.</li>
        <li>At any point prior to debt payoff, creditor may choose to write off the remaining amount as a loss and terminate the repayment plan.</li>
    </ul>

    We believe this approach is generally fair to all parties, avoids the problem of excessive and drawn-out litigation that plagues the present-day US system, and is consistent with the underlying values and principles of the State regarding personal responsibility and human rights. Debtors are required to live up to their word and repay debts they have agreed to repay. Creditors are expected to assess the creditworthiness of those requesting financing, as a matter of good business practice, and to accept business losses caused by their own actions. Debtors are protected from contracts that use "tricky" legalese to entrap people who are not legal or financial experts. The system is not burdened with lawsuits related to debt collection. Debtors will not be financially ruined as a result of failure to repay a debt.
