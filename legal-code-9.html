<em>Incorporation</em>
</p>

<p>
9. Incorporation.
<br/>
This section of the legal code concerns the formation, operation, and dissolution of private-sector organizations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.1. Everyone is entitled to form an organization to conduct business, provide social services, carry out religious rites, engage in an activity of shared interest, or any other lawful purpose.
   <br/>
   CR: 5.2.3
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.2. The State will establish an agency to serve as the main point of contact between the private sector and the Government. This agency will define standards, guidelines, and administrative procedures to facilitate the formation, operation, and dissolution of private-sector organizations. The <em>intent of the law</em> is to make these procedures easy and inexpensive for the people. The <em>intent of the law</em> is to establish the rules and procedures for forming and dissolving organizations at the level of <em>regulations</em> rather than <em>statutory law</em>, so that modifications will be easier than changes to statutory law.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.3. All private organizations are subject to the Constitution and the Legal Code. Their internal rules and procedures must not violate Constitutional principles or legal statutes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.4. An incorporated entity will not serve as a legal shield for its founders, owners, managers, operators, or employees. Every individual is responsible for the choices they make, including choices made in the context of operating an organization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.5. A private organization whose purpose is to provide social services at no cost to the public may apply for special tax status. Religious rites are not considered a "social service" for purposes of this statute.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.6. A private organization whose operations pertain to the Three Pillars of Independence will be subject to the relevant regulations and oversight.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.7. Revenues earned by a for-profit organization and funds collected by a non-profit organization that exceed the total amount of legal compensation paid to the founders, owners, operators, managers, members, employees, and contractors of that organization are considered to belong to the organization as such, and are not the private property of any individual.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	9.7.1. Corollary: Should an organization hold funds at the time of its dissolution after paying all creditors, the remaining funds are transferred to the general fund of the State and applied to the accounts of all members of the organization in equal proportion. 

<p class="indent">
   9.8. The financial records of all organizations will be transparent and available to the public. The <em>intent of the law</em> is that access to such records be easy, and that no fee is charged for such access.
</p>

<p class="indent">
   9.9. The membership and business operations of all organizations will be transparent and available to the public. The <em>intent of the law</em> is that access to such records be easy, and that no fee is charged for such access.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	9.9.1. Corollary: Due to operational and financial transparency required by law, there is no need for a statutory definition of the internal management structure or operating procedures of organizations. Anyone who believes they have been harmed by the internal management structure or operating procedures of an organization has the right to file suit for damages and/or to report the organization to the authorities for an offense, for instance a violation of human rights or legal rights.
</p>

<p class="indent">

</p>

<p class="indent2">

</p>

<p class="indent">
	9.11. Sale, Purchase, Division, Merger, and Dissolution of Organizations
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	9.11.1. Any organization may be sold, purchased, divided into multiple organizations, merged with another organization, or dissolved altogether at the discretion of its members, based on any internal procedures defined for the organization, limited only by other statutes.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	9.11.2. Proceeds from the sale or merger of an organization, or funds left over after dissolution of the organization and payment of any creditors, may be distributed among the members of the organization according to any otherwise-legal internal procedures defined for such purposes, limited by the general compensation caps defined in the law. After such distribution, should any funds remain they will be placed in the small business assistance account managed by the Government under statute 9.12.
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	9.11.2.1. Corollary: Anyone entitled to receive funds from the sale or dissolution of an organization who cannot receive all such funds in the same year as the sale or dissolution due to the general compensation cap, may receive payments from the general fund in subsequent years when their compensation falls below the cap, until they have received all the funds to which they are entitled. They cannot receive such payments in years when their compensation reaches the cap.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
