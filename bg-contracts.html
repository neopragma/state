<h2>1. Agreements (Verbal) and Contracts (Written)</h2>

<p>
	In the present-day US system, contracts may be in written or verbal form. Verbal contracts are always problematic. Under the State system, a written contract is considered a legally-binding <em>contract</em>. If the "contract" is not written, then it is considered an <em>agreement</em>. 
</p>

<a name="enforceability"/>
<h3>1.1. Enforceability of Verbal Agreements</h3>
<p>
	It is possible to engage the court system to rule on and possibly enforce a written contract. The difficulty in verifying exactly what the parties agreed to makes it impractical to enforce verbal agreements in court. The parties to a verbal agreement are free to file suit, but they are advised it will be difficult to get a clear ruling in the absence of anything in writing. The parties are best advised to seek mitigation or arbitration on their own, when a conflict arises pertaining to a verbal agreement.
</p>
<p>
	In most cases, people are best advised to walk away from the agreement and accept their losses. They should consider obtaining a written contract the next time they enter into an agreement. Courts are likely to rule that the party or parties harmed by the failure to execute the terms of the verbal agreement exercised their <em>free choice of reckless action</em> when they failed to get the agreement in writing.
</p>

<a name="contract"/>
<h3>1.2. What Makes a Contract a Contract</h3>
<p>
	The State recognizes the same five factors as present-day US law to identify a written agreement as a legally-binding contract:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Offer - Party 1 makes an offer to Party 2</li>
		<li>Acceptance - Party 2 accepts Party 1's offer</li>
		<li>Capacity - all parties understand the obligations of the contract</li>
		<li>Consideration - Party 2 exchanges something of value in return for Party 1's performance of the offer</li>
		<li>Intention - all parties must show their clear intention to enter into the terms of the contract</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Under the State system, all parties to a contract must sign the contract. This is not always required under present-day US law. The signatures can be traditional physical ones, or verifiable electronic ones. 
</p>
<p>
	The question of <em>capacity</em> has different meaning under the State system than it has under the present-day US system. When a contract is excessively long and complicated, and is crafted in a way that is confusing for a "lay person" to understand, a court may void it on the basis that it is "tricky," and violates the <em>intent</em> of Statute 1.6.1 prohibiting "abuse of the system." Recall that the <em>intent</em> of the law supercedes the <em>letter</em> of the law under the State system. 
</p>
<p>
	People are advised to "read the fine print," but simply to say, "you should have read the fine print" is no defense, because legalese can be difficult for an ordinary person to understand. In fact, it can be so difficult to understand that the use of tricky language in a contract is a stronger consideration than the <em>free exercise of reckless action</em> on the part of the party who did not fully understand what they were signing. If plaintiff can convince the court the wording of a contract is sufficiently vague, the court is likely to rule in their favor. Note that the definition of "tricky" is an ordinary person's definition, not an attorney's definition.
</p>
<p>
	Advice for those who craft contract language: Resist the temptation to add more and more words in an attempt to cover every conceivable combination and permutation of events that may occur. Use concise and straightforward language that an ordinary person with a basic education is likely to understand without the need for a legal expert to explain everything. In the event of a dispute, complicated contract language will not help you or your client in court; it will have the opposite effect.
</p>
<p>
	Advice for anyone entering into a contract: If the language of the contract <em>seems</em> excessively complicated to you (based on your gut intuition or common sense), then the terms of the contract probably <em>are</em> excessively complicated. That means in case of a dispute in future, it will be difficult to unravel the contract to figure out how to resolve the dispute justly. If the terms of an agreement cannot be explained in a few simple sentences that do not contradict each other, then you should not sign.
</p>

<a name="legality"/>
<h3>1.3. Legality</h3>
<p>
	Any contract that requires either party to engage in an action contrary to law will be void.
</p>

<a name="integration"/>
<h3>1.4. Integration</h3>
<p>
	The concept of <em>integration</em> is the same as under the present-day US system. A <em>partially-integrated</em> contract represents the latest version of part of the agreement between the parties. A <em>fully-integrated</em> contract represents the complete agreement between the parties. This is usually expressed in contracts with wording such as, "This represents the entire agreement," and so forth. 
</p>
<p>
	In case of a dispute, it is easier to understand the intentions of the parties when the contract is fully integrated. A partially-integrated contract invites extrinsic or "parol" evidence when the court interprets the contract. This is not "wrong" or "bad" but can complicate the interpretation of the contract.  
</p>
<p>
	The parol evidence rule states that if the language of a contract is ambiguous or vague, then evidence of prior negotations between the parties may be considered to help a court understand the intent of the contract. According to Example 2 below, the "Corbin view" of parol evidence is that "the court considers all the profferred evidence to determine its relevance to the parties' intent and then applies the parol evidence rule to exclude from the fact finder's consideration only the evidence that contradicts or varies the meaning of the agreement." The rationale for this view is that the basic parol evidence rule is a kind of Catch-22 - the court cannot determine the relevance of extrinsic evidence unless it can properly understand the intent of the contract, and it cannot properly understand the intent of the contract unless extrensic evidence is considered that clarifies the ambiguous or vague language in the contract. 
</p>
<p>
	We appreciate the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court as described in Example 2 below. Courts will consider extrinsic evidence first in order to determine its relevance to the interpretation of the contract in dispute. We think this approach weakens the distinction between partially- and fully-integrated contracts, but that is not important because the approach also improves the court's chances of properly understanding the parties' intent. We observe that the language of contracts is <em>always</em> ambiguous and subject to interpretation, and that in many cases this is intentional on the part of the party that has greater power or legal expertise. 
</p>

<a name="severability"/>
<h3>1.5. Severability</h3>
<p>
	The concept of <em>severability</em> is the same as under the present-day US system. Should a court determine a provision of a contract is unenforceable, the offending provision can be "severed" from the contract without voiding the other provisions. Example 1 (<em>Surpass Senior Living LLC</em>) and Example 3 (<em>Valley Medical Specialists vs. Steven S. Farber and Susan H. Farber</em>) illustrate how an unreasonable provision can be severed from a contract, leaving the rest of the contract intact and enforceable. 
</p>

<a name="inviolability"/>
<h3>1.6. Inviolability</h3>
<p>
	Historically in the US, the idea of the <em>inviolability of contracts</em> has been used to enforce one-sided work agreements between powerful corporations and relatively helpless, economically-desperate individuals. We see legal contracts as important guides for the interaction between the signatories, not to be dismissed lightly. However, contracts can never override or supersede human rights, legal rights, the Three Pillars of Independence, or Kindergarten Wisdom. Those who try to use the terms of a contract to cause harm to others will find little legal support in the State court system. Contracts must be <em>fair</em>.
