</p>
<h1>Backgrounder: Age of Majority</h1>

<p>
How did we arrive at 16 as the age of majority? There are three reasons.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Precedent</h3>
</p>
<p>
Research indicates the human brain does not complete its development until an individual reaches the age of about 25 to 27. Yet, we currently set lower ages for various purposes - get a driver's license at age 16; consent to sex, join the military at age 18; drink alcohol, smoke at age 21. Therefore, we already accept the age of majority to be below the age at which the human brain is fully developed. As that precedent is already set and people accept it as normal, the choice of an age amounts to little more than picking a number. 
</p>
<p>
Those who accept 18 as normal have no real argument against 16 as normal. One can make a logical argument in favor of age 25 or 26, but for any age below 25 every number is a compromise. 
</p>
<h3>School and Work</h3>
<p>
If the differences between a 16-year-old and an 18-year-old are minor, then why have we chosen the age of 18 for most purposes in the current system? It is because our current system defines 12 years of basic schooling starting at age 6, after which the individual is expected to join the work force and establish their own residence. It would be impractical (as well as undesirable for most families) to have the young person continue living under the care of parents, as a "child," after they have completed high school and are working full time.
</p>
<p>
Under the proposed system, basic schooling will consist of 8 years, after which an individual may choose to pursue further formal education, assuming they are qualified, or may join the work force. Furthermore, the State has first grade starting at age 7 or 8, rather than age 6, and there is no kindergarten. This is based on the performance of national educational systems in other countries whose students demonstrate superior results to ours. They have learned that starting formal schooling outside the home at a younger age offers no advantages, and may even lead to developmental issues. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, 8 years of basic schooling brings the student to the age of 15 or 16. For vocational students, this leaves a year for vocational training and apprenticeship. For academic students, it leads smoothly into the first year of college, or allows for a year off before starting college. 
</p>
<h3>Observed Behavior Patterns</h3>
<p>
Our observation of the general behavior of the majority of Americans is that they behave no differently at the age of 26 than they did at the age of 16. Indeed, they continue to behave the same at 36, 46, 56, and 66 years of age. The general pattern is that they prefer to spend their time drinking alcohol, having sex, and watching sports. As they are not going to behave any differently at 26 than at 16, they might as well begin adult life at 16. 
</p>
<p>
Young people usually begin drinking and having sex prior to the age of 18, notwithstanding current law, health implications, customs and mores, or religious teaching. There is no sense in pretending otherwise. 
</p>
<p>
As the State supports individual liberty, including religious liberty, there is nothing in State law to prevent a family, community, or religious order from encouraging young people to follow its rules and adopt its system of moral values. Therefore, even if the legal age of majority is set at 16, communities that believe it is desirable for people to wait a few years longer before engaging in certain activities are completely free to teach that belief. The State will not interfere.
