<em>Torts</em>
</p>

<p>
15. Torts.
<br/>
This section of the legal code concerns torts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.1. Definitions.  
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.1.1. Tort. A <em>tort</em> is an action (or lack of action) that results in some form of harm to one or more people. The harm may be physical, financial, or emotional.  
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.1.2. Intentional Tort. When someone deliberately causes harm the tort is considered to be intentional. Both compensatory and punitive damages may apply.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.1.3. Negligence Tort. When someone fails to take reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent or avoid harm to others in a manner that an ordinary person would expect in the normal course of affairs, the tort is considered to be due to negligence. Compensatory damages may apply.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.1.4. Strict Liability Torts. In some legal systems, a person may be held liable for harm even if no crime was committed and they acted with due diligence as an ordinary person would reasonably expect in the normal course of affairs. This type of tort is not recognized in State law and is not actionable.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	15.1.5. Comparative Negligence. The court may find that both parties involved in a tort case have a share of the blame for the incident that caused harm. Amounts for compensatory and/or punitive damages may offset each other, resulting in a smaller judgment against one of the parties, or effectively a wash. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.2. Statute of Limitations. Suits requesting financial compensation or punitive damages must be filed within two (2) calendar years of the date the harm was suffered. Exception: When the harm arising from an action or event does not manifest within two years of the event, then suit may be brought at any time. The burden of proof then lies with plaintiff to show the connection between the action or event and the harm that was suffered at a later time.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	15.3. Responsible Parties. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	15.3.1. Corporate Defendants. The executive officers of the corporation are personally responsible for suits brought against the corporation for intentional or negligence torts. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	15.3.2. Individual Defendants. The individual who took (or failed to take) action resulting in harm is personally responsible for suits brought against them for intentional or negligence torts.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	15.3.3. Government Defendants. The National Council as an entity (not its individual members) bears responsibility on behalf of the State for suits brought against the Government for intentional or negligence torts. 
</p>


<p class="indent">
	15.4. Limitations on Awards.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	15.4.1. Corporate Defendants. The maximum amount that may be awarded for compensatory damages <em>per count</em> is 6% of the total net worth of the corporation, to be paid from corporate assets, plus 3% of the personal net worth of each of the corporation's officers, to be paid from their personal assets. The total maximum amount that may be awarded is 12.5% of the total net worth of the corporation and 25% of the total net worth of the responsible individuals. The maximum amount that may be awarded for punitive damages for intentional torts (in total, not per count) is 8% of the net worth of the corporation, to be paid from corporate assets, plus 5% of the personal net worth of each of the corporation's officers, to be paid from their personal assets.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	15.4.2. Individual Defendants. The maximum amount that may be awarded for compensatory and punitive damages is 5% of the total net worth of the responsible individual. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	15.4.3. Government Defendants. The maximum amount that may be awarded for compensatory and punitive damages is $10,000,000, regardless of the number of plaintiffs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.5. Should a court determine that the officers of a corporation have organized their company in a way intended to avoid personal responsibility for their own business decisions, the individual leaders of the corporation may be prosecuted under Statute 1.6.1 prohibiting abuse of the legal system for personal ends. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.6. In no case may a court require an individual to pay the court costs and attorney fees for a corporation, even if the corporation prevails in the suit. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.7. In no case may the outcome of a suit result in the loss of anyone's primary residence or their means of work (tools, transportation, etc.). 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.8. Plaintiff may file suit claiming either an intentional or a negligence tort. The court may change the category based on its consideration of the facts. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	<em>Note:</em> Should the court deem it likely that plaintiff filed an intentional tort case <em>only</em> to try and obtain punitive damages on top of legitimate compensation, the court may investigate this to determine whether plaintiff has violated Statute 1.6.1 prohibiting abuse of the legal system for personal ends. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.9. Defendant may offer settlement at any time, and plaintiff may accept such settlement at any time during the process. Should this occur, the suit is dismissed. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	<em>Note 1:</em> If plaintiff requests or demands a settlement when none has been offered by defendant, the court may see this as evidence of abuse of the system under Statute 1.6.1, using tort law as a "weapon" to extract money from defendant. 
</p>
<p class="indent2">
	<em>Note 2:</em> Should the court notice a pattern of filing intentional tort suits for negligence tort cases on the part a given attorney or law firm, the court may see this as evidence of abuse of the system under Statute 1.6.1, using tort law as a "weapon" to extract money from defendants. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.10. Should a court find comparable negligence, judgments against the respective parties will offset each other.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.11. Court Costs and Legal Fees.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.11.1. In case of judgment for plaintiff for an intentional tort, defendant must pay all court costs and legal fees for both sides, mitigated by other statutes in this section. 
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.11.2. In case of judgment for plaintiff for a negligence tort, each party is responsible for their own court costs and legal fees. 
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.11.3. In case of judgment for defendant, plaintiff must pay all court costs and legal fees for both sides, mitigated by other statutes in this section. 
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.11.4. Any party involved in a tort case may ask the court to waive court costs based on their lack of ability to pay.
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	15.11.4.1. Corollary: Should a court deny a request to waive court fees, and the party loses the case, and it is later determined that the party genuinely could not afford the court costs, then the harmed party may sue the Government at Government expense to recover damages in the amount of the court costs.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.11.5. Any party involved in a tort case may ask the Government for financial assistance to cover court costs and legal fees based on their lack of ability to pay. 
</p>

<p class="indent3">
	15.11.5.1. Corollary: This means it is possible an individual could sue the Government and the Government would cover their costs for doing so.
</p>


<p class="indent">
	15.12. Payment of Tort Judgments
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.12.1. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, defendant has six (6) months to begin payment of the amount due.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.12.2. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, within six (6) months defendant may negotiate a payment plan with the court based on the value of their assets and their earning capacity. Should their earning capacity change before full payment has been made, they may re-negotiate the terms of the payment plan with the court. Such re-negotiation may occur as many times as necessary until the debt is paid or defendant files for bankruptcy (for a negligence tort) or defendant dies.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.12.3. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, under no circumstances will plaintiff be entitled to any accrual of interest on the amount due.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.12.4. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, under no circumstances will the household members or heirs of defendent be liable for the judgment.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.12.5. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, should defendant fail to make payments for the debt after all appeals have been completed and the time period to begin payments has expired, <em>and</em> plaintiff makes no formal complaint to the court regarding non-payment for a period of two (2) calendar years from the due date of the first payment, then the behavior of plaintiff will erase the debt based on <em>accord and satisfaction</em>.
</p>


<p class="indent">
	15.13. Appeals of Tort Judgments
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.13.1. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, defendant has six (6) months to notify the court in writing of their intent to appeal, and one (1) calendar year from the date of judgment to file the appeal. During this time, no payments are due to plaintiff.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.13.2. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, and upholding of that ruling by the appellate court, defendant may escalate the appeal to the High Court. Defendant must notify the appellate court in writing of their intent to escalate the case within six (6) months of the appellate court's ruling, and file their appeal with the High Court within one (1) calendar year of the date of the appellate judgment. During this time, no payments are due to plaintiff.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.13.3. Following a ruling in favor of plaintiff, and overturning of that ruling by the appellate court, all moneys received by plaintiff uder the previous ruling must be repaid to defendant. The matter is then closed.
</p>

<p class="indent2">
	15.13.4. Following a ruling of comparable negligence, the party against whom the larger judgment is made will have the same right of appeal as the defendant described in Statute 15.13.1.
</p>


<p class="indent">
	15.14. Tort judgments are not inheritable. When an individual who has a tort ruling against them dies, the ruling dies with them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
	15.15. Offenses against the State or people of America are criminal offenses by definition; by definition, civil torts cannot be perpetrated against the State or Government. Therefore, the Government cannot bring a civil tort suit against anyone.
