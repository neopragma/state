<h2>1. Overview of Governmental Structure</h2>

<p>
This section presents an overview of the structure of the State government and a summary of the main functions of each part of the government.
</p>

<p class="centered">
	<a href="media/state-hierarchy.jpg" target="diagram" title="Click/tap to expand"><img src="media/state-hierarchy.jpg" width="800" align="center" alt="State Hierarchy Diagram"/></a>
</p>

<a name="nationalcouncil"/>
<h3>1.1. National Council</h3>

<p>
This is the primary decision-making body for the country. It comprises fifteen (15) people who are considered peers, although they may decide to elect or designate a spokesperson to act as "head of state" for purposes of discussions with foreign countries that do not understand peer-based group leadership. Such a spokesperson will not actually have more power than other members of the council. 
</p>
<p>
The National Council is responsible for nearly all the functions of the Executive and Legislative branches of the old US government. As a way to achieve some measure of checks and balances, as well as to protect the country from the occasional outbreak of mass stupidity on the part of grassroots voters, council membership is governed as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Members are elected from among individuals who have served on the National Advisory Board and/or the Legal Review Board for a minimum of five (5) years.</li>
		<li>Members of the National Advisory Board vote for candidates to the National Council. The general public does not have a vote in this.</li>
		<li>There is a strict term limit of three (3) years.</li>
		<li>Members are elected on a rotating basis, with three (3) members replaced every three (3) years. The intent is that tenure is long enough to provide consistency in policy, and short enough to mitigate the risk of corruption.</li>
		<li>Any member who forfeits Full Citizenship while on the Council is immediately removed from the Council.</li>
		<li>When a member leaves the Council in the midst of a three-year term, they are replaced within four (4) weeks by a vote of the National Advisory Board. The replacement member completes the former member's 3-year term; they do not begin their own personal 3-year term. If members leave within eight (8) weeks of the next Council election, they need not be replaced on an interim basis.</li>
		<li>After completing a term of service, an individual cannot be re-elected to the Council until after a waiting period of nine (9) years. This is an anti-corruption measure - due to the rotation of members every 3 years, it is unlikely any co-conspirators would still be on the Council after 9 years.</li>
		<li>A member who must leave the Council for any reason other than a criminal conviction may stand for election again as soon as they have regained Fulled Citizenship.</li>
		<li>No person over the age of seventy-five (75) may serve on the Council.</li>
		<li>No person currently serving in the military may serve on the Council.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Modification for the Transition period: Initially, all 15 members are elected at once. Every three (3) years, the National Advisory Board votes out three (3) <em>or more</em> members and replaces them with new members on a 3-year term. No orginal member may remain on the Council more than nine (9) years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note: 1</em> Although any Full Citizen who has reached the age of majority can participate in the society as an adult, the additional requirements for higher education and service on the National Advisory Board or Legal Review Board effectively mean that only mature adults with a certain amount of life experience will be able to join the National Council. Realistically, a person would have to be at least 30 years old (approximately) to fulfill the requirements.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note 2:</em> The maximum age is set as a response to a problem in the present-day US system whereby an inordinate number of US Senators are extremely old, and often exhibit behavior that suggests they are not "firing on all cylinders." Even those who appear to be mentally sharp are still living in the past, fighting the last century's battles, and do not seem to be engaged with present-day realities, especially with respect to international relations.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note 3:</em> The prohibition on active-duty military personnel serving on the Council is a protective measure to reduce the risk of a "soft" military takeover of the civilian government, as has happened in a number of countries in the past couple of centuries.
</p>

<a name="advisoryboard"/>
<h3>1.2. National Advisory Board</h3>

<p>
The National Advisory Board comprises one thousand (1,000) individuals who are Full Citizens with higher education. 
</p>
<p>
The National Advisory Board has the following functions:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Conduct research and analysis and provide advice to the National Council. The Board may engage the services of outside experts to assist in this work.</li>
		<li>Observe the activities and decisions of the National Council, and raise an alarm when they believe they perceive evidence of fraud, corruption, or incompetence.</li>
		<li>Submit queries or requests to the Legal Review Board to obtain information and opinions about potential problems with the National Council.</li>
		<li>Offer themselves or nominate their peers to join the National Council, and participate in voting by the Board to elect Council members.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Election and tenure:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Candidates for the Board may begin their election campaigns six (6) months before election day.</li>
    	<li>Members are elected by popular vote of all Full Citizens.</li>
    	<li>Terms are five (5) years long.</li>
    	<li>One hundred (100) members are elected annually.</li>
    	<li>Former members may run again after a five (5) year waiting period.</li>
    	<li>For members who are elected to the National Council, the waiting period includes their time on the Council.</li>
		<li>Any member who forfeits Full Citizenship while on the Council is immediately removed from the Board.</li>
		<li>A member who must leave the Board for any reason other than a criminal conviction may stand for election again as soon as they have regained Full Citizenship.</li>
		<li>No person over the age of seventy-five (75) may serve on the Board.</li>
		<li>No person currently serving in the military may serve on the Board.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Modification for the Transition period: Initially, all 1,000 members are elected at once. For the first ten (10) years, voters choose 100 members to replace in each annual election. The replacements begin 5-year terms. By the end of the first 10 years, all the initial 1,000 members must have been replaced.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> Although any Full Citizen who has reached the age of majority can participate in the society as an adult, the additional requirement for higher education effectively means that only people who are in their mid-twenties will be eligible for election to the National Advisory Board.
</p>


<a name="legalreviewboard"/>
<h3>1.3. Legal Review Board</h3>

<p>
The Legal Review Board is loosely equivalent to the Judicial Branch of the present-day US government. It comprises a mixture of full-time employees, elected officials, and appointed officials. The Board has three functions: 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Conduct reviews of proposed changes in the law to ensure conformity with the Constitution and to maintain overall consistency in the Legal Code (that is, ensure one statute does not contradict another). This work is done by the Legislative Review Unit.</li>
		<li>Support the work of the National Advisory Board by conducting legal research and providing opinions. This work is done by the Legislative Review Unit.</li>
		<li>Consider petitions, complaints, and appeals; and hear cases brought before the High Court.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<a name="legislativereview"/>
<h4>1.3.1. Legislative Review Unit</h4>

<p>
The Legislative Review Unit comprises twenty (20) individuals in the following proportions:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ten (5) senior/experienced legal scholars or practicing/retired attorneys/judges (full-time employees)</li>
		<li>Ten (5) junior legal scholars, possibly recent graduates of law schools or practitioners with limited experience (say, under 10 years)</li>
		<li>Five (5) individuals with relevant professional backgrounds appointed by the National Council for a term of no more than ten (10) years</li>
		<li>Five (5) individuals elected by the popular vote of Full Citizens for a term of no more than ten (10) years</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
There may also be a variable number of employees in office support roles.
</p>
<p>
Part of the normal cycle of legislation is the review by the Legislative Review Unit. There may be back-and-forth between the Unit and the National Advisory Board and/or the National Council until a proposed legislative change is either approved or denied. The details are defined in statutory law.
</p>
<p>
The Unit also responds to requests for information and advice from the National Advisory Board and other operating units of the government as needed.
</p>


<a name="highcourt"/>
<h4>1.3.2. High Court</h4>

<p>
The High Court is loosely equivalent to the US Supreme Court under the present-day US system. It is the "highest court in the land," with the mandate to resolve cases that lower courts were unable to decide, and to consider cases brought forward for review or legal opinion. They also hear cases brought directly to the Court to challenge statutory law or governmental procedures on Constitutional grounds. 
</p>
<p>
The people can petition the Court to hear a case, bypassing the National Council and the National Advisory Board. The procedures for this are defined in statutory law.
</p>


<a name="militaryliaison"/>
<h3>1.4. Military Liaison</h3>

<p>
The State subscribes to the principle that the military must be subordinate to civilian authority, as well as the principle that the military must be free to operate relatively autonomously of the civilian government in order to carry out its mission effectively. This office is responsible for assuring balance between these two principles, which can conflict at times. 
</p>
<p>
The Liaison will have two civilian members from the National Council who serve on a rotating basis, elected by their Council peers. It will also have the appropriate number of senior military officers necessary to fulfill its mission. In practice, the Liaison will be approximately the same as the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the present-day US system. 
</p>


<a name="firstnationsliaison"/>
<h3>1.5. First Nations Liaison</h3>

<p>
This organization is responsible for relations between the State and each of the Native American peoples living within the territory of America.
</p>
<p>
The Liaison office is responsible for ensuring the First Nations receive all the rights, privileges, and benefits due them under State law, and to help them navigate the intricacies of the government bureaucracy. The Liaison may also initiate outreach, educational, and informationals programs to inform Americans about First Nations' history, cultures, and languages. 
</p>
<p>
The Liaison will comprise four (4) individuals plus whatever staff support they require. The 4 key individuals are:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Two (2) appointees of the National Council, selected from Full Citizens with higher education. They have a variable term of service and may be removed if it is shown they are not performing the function properly.</li>
    	<li>Two (2) representatives of First Nations, selected by whatever method the First Nations may define, serving whatever term the First Nations may decide.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
				
<a name="securityservice"/>
<h3>1.6. State Security Service</h3>

<p>
This is the umbrella organization for all civilian law enforcement, investigative, and intelligence-gathering operations of the State. Everyone in the Service is a State employee. It is the top-level management organization for law enforcement nationwide. In addition to the management function, the Service has five key roles:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Physical security of public figures</li>
		<li>Law enforcement</li>
		<li>Criminal investigation</li>
		<li>Intelligence-gathering</li>
		<li>Rapid emergency response</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<a name="protectionunit"/>
<h4>1.6.1. Protection Unit</h4>

<p>
The Protection Unit is responsible for the physical safety of government officials and other notables as may be designated by the National Council while they are traveling or appearing in public places. 
</p>


<a name="enforcementunit"/>
<h4>1.6.2. Enforcement Unit</h4>

<p>
The Enforcement Unit is the top-level law enforcement entity in the country. Its functions include pursuit and arrest of suspects, verification of reasonable cause, and initiation of due process for prosecution.
</p>

<a name="investigationunit"/>
<h4>1.6.3. Investigation Unit</h4>

<p>
The Investigation Unit is the top-level criminal investigative agency of the State. Its functions emcompass those of multiple organizations in the present-day US system, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and state bureaus of investigation; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and others.
</p>

<a name="intelligenceunit"/>
<h4>1.6.4. Intelligence Unit</h4>

<p>
The Intelligence Unit is the top-level management entity and umbrella organization for both international and domestic intelligence-gathering. Its functions encompass those of the Central Intelligence Agency; the National Security Agency; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; some functions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and some functions of the Department of the Treasury.
</p>

<a name="rapidresponseunit"/>
<h4>1.6.5. Rapid Response Unit</h4>

<p>
The Rapid Response Unit deals with emergent, dangerous situations of all kinds. These may include terrorist acts, criminal acts, hostage scenarios, accidents of significant scope (e.g., oil tanker spill), and natural disasters. The Unit coordinates regional and local emergency response teams as needed, depending on the nature and scope of the emergency.
</p>

<a name="rapidresponseunit"/>
<h4>1.6.6. Border Control Unit</h4>

<p>
Responsible for protecting the national borders against unauthorized entry, including (a) non-Citizens holding valid visas who attempt to enter the country at a point other than a designated border crossing, and (b) non-Citizens not holding valid visas. Responsible to identifying individuals at border crossings who attempting to leave the country and who are wanted by law enforcement, and preventing their egress. Responsible to enforcing customs laws.
</p>

<a name="prisonunit"/>
<h4>1.6.7. Prison Unit</h4>

<p>
Responsible for standards-setting and oversight of the national prison system, as well as overall operational management of the system.
</p>



<a name="#stateoperations"/>
<h3>1.7. State Operations</h3>

<p>
"Operations" is a broad term that includes all the day-to-day activities of government. This is by far the largest government entity of the State. It has many more functions beyond the few shown in the overview diagram. 
</p>
<p>
Most of the functions carried out by the myriad of agencies and bureaus in the present-day US Executive and Legislative Branches are subsumed under the heading, "operations." Under the present-day US system, many functions are redundant, overlapping, or obsolete; or are rendered moot by differences in the State system. Yet, there still remain many necessary government functions that must be supported.

<a name="parties"/>
<h2>2. Political Parties</h2>

<p>
The State system is non-partisan; beyond that, it is <em>anti-</em>partisan, in keeping with the practical purpose of the State. The State does not represent a political party in the same way as communist governments always represent the Communist Party and fascist governments always represent the Fascist Party. Nor does the government operate on a partisan basis, as the present-day US operates, with two parties competing with each other for influence and canceling out each other's initiatives. 
</p>
<p>
Under the State system, there are no political parties. The State itself is not and does not represent any political party. 
</p>
<p>
It is natural for like-minded people to associate with one another and seek to promote legislation they agree with, but if that is taken too far it can be seen as undermining the Three Pillars of Independence. This sort of collaboration will not be permitted to reach the level that political parties are established.
</p>

<a name="lobbying"/>
<h2>3. Lobbying</h2>

<p>
Lobbying is considered a form of corruption, and is illegal. As the favoritism lobbying seeks can undermine the Three Pillars of Independence, it is a Category 1 offense.
</p>

<a name="transition"/>
<h2>4. Transition Planning, Management and Oversight</h2>

This is a special operating unit of the government with the responsibility to plan, guide, assess, and oversee the transition from the United States governmental structure to the State governmental structure. The intent is to dissolve this operating unit upon completion of the transition. 
</p>


<a name="statetousxref"/>
<h2>5. Functional Cross-Reference of State Operating Units and US Government Entities</h2>

<p>
State equivalents of US Independent Agencies are not listed, as these functions are generally integrated with the normal activities of the National Council, National Advisory Board, and/or Legal Review Board and are not managed by separate, permanent bureaucracies.

<h2>6. Functional Cross-Reference of US Government Entities and State Operating Units</h2>

<p>
This cross-reference provides a general guide to where each responsibility of government will go when it is transitioned from the US to the State governmental structure.
</p>
<p>
The following are not listed individually, as their functions would be carried out by temporary working groups under the State system, so there are no permanent bureaucracies corresponding to each bureau. The intent is that these would be reviwed during the Transition to determine which, if any, should be established, and whether any of their functions logically belong to permanent administrative organizations.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Executive Department Sub-Agencies and Bureaus; and</li>
    	<li>Executive Boards, Commissions, and Committees that are established by Congress or the President to accomplish specific tasks.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Omitting those listed above, the following table shows how the functions of each US government entity correspond with the operating units of the State government structure.
</p>
